TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
OR
Regular Session, 2025 H. B. 24-
A BILL FOR AN ACT
To enact a Uniform Electronic Transactions Act to enable a more
robust digital economy in the Commonwealth.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24TH NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Findings and Purpose. Strengthening our legal framework is
2 essential if the Commonwealth is to keep pace with how people live, work, and do
3 business today. The Uniform Law Commission approved the Uniform Electronic
4 Transactions Act (UETA) in 1999, and Congress followed in 2000 with the federal
5 Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (ESIGN; 15 U.S.C. §
6 7001 et seq.). Yet without a CNMI statute of our own, residents, agencies, and
7 businesses remain uncertain about whether electronic records and signatures will
8 hold up. That uncertainty carries costs, slows service, and keeps us tethered to
9 outdated paper systems.
10 In nearly every U.S. jurisdiction-49 states, the District of Columbia,
11 Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands—electronic records and signatures are treated
12 as equal to paper. Only New York has charted a different course, adopting its own
13 electronic signature statute. The principle is simple: what matters is the intent and

ara,
HOUSE BILL 24-
1 reliability of the transaction, not the medium in which it is captured. Giving
2 electronic signatures and records the same legal effect as their paper counterparts
3 lowers costs, widens access, and treats residents fairly no matter where they live.
4 Gaps in our law put Commonwealth residents and agencies at a
5 disadvantage. Without uniform rules, some offices insist on paper, others improvise
6 with their own electronic policies, and the result is inconsistency, duplication, and
7 confusion. Businesses and consumers pay the price in delays and added expenses,
8 and agencies cannot fully modernize. Unless the law is brought into line with
9 established national standards, the Commonwealth will continue to face barriers to
10 efficient service and economic growth.
11 Navigating the modern economy requires rules that bring order and
12 predictability to digital dealings. By adopting the Uniform Electronic Transactions
13 Act, the Commonwealth places electronic signatures and records on firm legal
14 ground and joins the vast majority of U.S. jurisdictions that have already acted.
15 This measure gives agencies clear authority to implement secure and practical
16 systems while allowing businesses and citizens the choice to continue with paper if
17 they wish. With its enactment, the Commonwealth promotes efficiency, trust, and
18 growth in both public service and private commerce.
19 Section 2. Amendment. Title 4. Economic Resources, Division 5.
20 Business Regulation, of the Commonwealth Code is hereby amended by adding a
21 new Chapter 23, titled, "Uniform Electronic Transactions Act" to be codified as
22 sections 55001 to 55018, to read as follows:

4 Signatures, and Electronic Contracts.
5 (a) A record or signature may not be denied legal effect or enforceability
6 solely because it is in electronic form.
7 (b) A contract may not be denied legal effect or enforceability solely
8 because an electronic record was used in its formation.

12 §55008. Provision of Information in Writing; Presentation of Records.
13 (a) If parties have agreed to conduct a transaction by electronic means and

18 if the sender or its information processing system inhibits the ability of the recipient
19 to print or store the electronic record.
20 (b) If a law other than this Act requires a record (i) to be posted or displayed
21 in a certain manner, (ii) to be sent, communicated, or transmitted by a specified

16 information be in the form of an electronic record capable of retention may
17 also be varied by agreement; and
18 (2) a requirement under a law other than this Act to send,
19 communicate, or transmit a record by United States mail, may be varied by

OZ
HOUSE BILL 24-
1 (a) An electronic record or electronic signature is attributable to a person if
2 it was the act of the person. The act of the person may be shown in any manner,
3 including a showing of the efficacy of any security procedure applied to determine
4 the person to which the electronic record or electronic signature was attributable.
5 (b) The effect of an electronic record or electronic signature attributed to a
6 person under subsection (a) is determined from the context and surrounding
7 circumstances at the time of its creation, execution, or adoption, including the
8 parties' agreement, if any, and otherwise as provided by law.
9 §55010. Effect of Change or Error.
10 If a change or error in an electronic record occurs in a transmission between
11 parties to a transaction, the following rules apply:
12 (a) If the parties have agreed to use a security procedure to detect changes
13 or errors and one party has conformed to the procedure, but the other party has not,
14 and the nonconforming party would have detected the change or error had that party
15 also conformed, the conforming party may avoid the effect of the changed or
16 erroneous electronic record.
17 (b) In an automated transaction involving an individual, the individual may
18 avoid the effect of an electronic record that resulted from an error made by the
19 individual in dealing with the electronic agent of another person if the electronic
20 agent did not provide an opportunity for the prevention or correction of the error
21 and, at the time the individual learns of the error, the individual:
- 10-

4z
HOUSE BILL 24-
1 (1) promptly notifies the other person of the error and that the
2 individual did not intend to be bound by the electronic record received by
3 the other person;
4 (2) takes reasonable steps, including steps that conform to the other
5 person's reasonable instructions, to return to the other person or, if
6 instructed by the other person, to destroy the consideration received, if any,
7 as a result of the erroneous electronic record; and
8 (3) has not used or received any benefit or value from the
9 consideration, if any, received from the other person.
10 (c) If neither subsection (a) nor subsection (b) applies, the change or error
11 has the effect provided by other law, including the law of mistake, and the parties'
12 contract, if any.
13 (d) Subsections (b) and (c) may not be varied by agreement.
14 §55011. Notarization and Acknowledgment.
15 If a law requires a signature or record to be notarized, acknowledged,
16 verified, or made under oath, the requirement is satisfied if the electronic signature
17 of the person authorized to perform those acts, together with all other information
18 required to be included by other applicable law, is attached to or logically
19 associated with the signature or record.
20 §55012. Retention of Electronic Records; Originals.
21 (a) If a law requires that a record be retained, the requirement is satisfied by
22 retaining an electronic record of the information in the record which:

04.
HOUSE BILL 24-
1 (1) accurately reflects the information set forth in the record after it
2 was first generated in its final form as an electronic record or otherwise; and
3 (2) remains accessible for later reference.
4 (b) A requirement to retain a record in accordance with subsection (a) does
5 not apply to any information the sole purpose of which is to enable the record to be
6 sent, communicated, or received.
7 (c) A person may satisfy subsection (a) by using the services of another
8 person if the requirements of that subsection are satisfied.
9 (d) If a law requires a record to be presented or retained in its original form,
10 or provides consequences if the record is not presented or retained in its original
11 form, that law is satisfied by an electronic record retained in accordance with
12 subsection (a).
13 (e) If a law requires retention of a check, that requirement is satisfied by
14 retention of an electronic record of the information on the front and back of the
15 check in accordance with subsection (a).
16 (f) A record retained as an electronic record in accordance with subsection
17 (a) satisfies a law requiring a person to retain a record for evidentiary, audit, or like
18 purposes, unless a law enacted after the effective date of this Act specifically
19 prohibits the use of an electronic record for the specified purpose.
20 (g) This section does not preclude a governmental agency of this
21 Commonwealth from specifying additional requirements for the retention of a
22 record subject to the agency's jurisdiction.

HOUSE BILL 24- 692.
1 §55013. Admissibility in Evidence.
2 In a proceeding, evidence of a record or signature may not be excluded
3 solely because it is in electronic form. Such admissibility shall remain subject to
4 the CNMI Rules of Evidence regarding authentication.
5 §55014. Automated Transaction.
6 In an automated transaction, the following rules apply:
7 (a) A contract may be formed by the interaction of electronic agents of the
8 parties, even if no individual was aware of or reviewed the electronic agents'
9 actions or the resulting terms and agreements.
10 (b) A contract may be formed by the interaction of an electronic agent and
11 an individual, acting on the individual's own behalf or for another person, including
12 by an interaction in which the individual performs actions that the individual is free
13 to refuse to perform and which the individual knows or has reason to know will
14 cause the electronic agent to complete the transaction or performance.
15 (c) The terms of the contract are determined by the substantive law
16 applicable to it.
17 §55015. Time and Place of Sending and Receipt.
18 (a) Unless otherwise agreed between the sender and the recipient, an
19 electronic record is sent when it:
20 (1) is addressed properly or otherwise directed properly to an
21 information processing system that the recipient has designated or uses for
- 13 -

44
HOUSE BILL 24-
1 the purpose of receiving electronic records or information of the type sent
2 and from which the recipient is able to retrieve the electronic record;
3 (2) is in a form capable of being processed by that system; and
4 (3) enters an information processing system outside the control of
5 the sender or of a person that sent the electronic record on behalf of the
6 sender or enters a region of the information processing system designated
7 or used by the recipient which is under the control of the recipient.
8 (b) Unless otherwise agreed between a sender and the recipient, an
9 electronic record is received when:
10 (1) it enters an information processing system that the recipient has
11 designated or uses for the purpose of receiving electronic records or
12 information of the type sent and from which the recipient is able to retrieve
13 the electronic record; and
14 (2) it is in a form capable of being processed by that system.
15 (c) Subsection (b) applies even if the place the infoi nation processing
16 system is located is different from the place the electronic record is deemed to be
17 received under subsection (d).
18 (d) Unless otherwise expressly provided in the electronic record or agreed
19 between the sender and the recipient, an electronic record is deemed to be sent from
20 the sender's place of business and to be received at the recipient's place of business.
21 For purposes of this subsection, the following rules apply:
- 14 -

QZ,
HOUSE BILL 24-
1 (1) If the sender or recipient has more than one place of business,
2 the place of business of that person is the place having the closest
3 relationship to the underlying transaction.
4 (2) If the sender or the recipient does not have a place of business,
5 the place of business is the sender's or recipient's residence, as the case may
6 be.
7 (e) An electronic record is received under subsection (b) even if no
8 individual is aware of its receipt.
9 (f) Receipt of an electronic acknowledgment from an information
10 processing system described in subsection (b) establishes that a record was received
11 but, by itself, does not establish that the content sent corresponds to the content
12 received.
13 (g) If a person is aware that an electronic record purportedly sent under
14 subsection (a), or purportedly received under subsection (b), was not actually sent
15 or received, the legal effect of the sending or receipt is determined by other
16 applicable law. Except to the extent permitted by the other law, the requirements of
17 this subsection may not be varied by agreement.
18 §55016. Transferable Record.
19 (a) In this section, "transferable record" means an electronic record that:
20 (1) would be a note under 5 CMC § 3104 or a document of title
21 under 5 CMC § 1201 if the electronic record were in writing; and
- 15 -

az
HOUSE BILL 24-
1 (2) the issuer of the electronic record expressly has agreed is a
2 transferable record.
3 (b) A person has control of a transferable record if a system employed for
4 evidencing the transfer of interests in the transferable record reliably establishes
5 that person as the person to which the transferable record was issued or transferred.
6 (c) A system satisfies subsection (b), and a person is deemed to have control
7 of a transferable record, if the transferable record is created, stored, and assigned in
8 such a manner that:
9 (1) a single authoritative copy of the transferable record exists which
10 is unique, identifiable, and, except as otherwise provided in subsection (c)
11 (4), (5), and (6), unalterable;
12 (2) the authoritative copy identifies the person asserting control as:
13 (A) the person to which the transferable record was issued;
14 Or
15 (B) if the authoritative copy indicates that the transferable
16 record has been transferred, the person to which the transferable
17 record was most recently transferred.
18 (3) the authoritative copy is communicated to and maintained by the
19 person asserting control or its designated custodian;
20 (4) copies or revisions that add or change an identified assignee of
21 the authoritative copy can be made only with the consent of the person
22 asserting control;
- 16 -

OX.
HOUSE BILL 24-
1 (5) each copy of the authoritative copy and any copy of a copy is
2 readily identifiable as a copy that is not the authoritative copy; and
3 (6) any revision of the authoritative copy is readily identifiable as
4 authorized or unauthorized.
5 (d) Except as otherwise agreed, a person having control of a transferable
6 record is the holder, as defined in 5 CMC § 1201 (20), of the transferable record
7 and has the same rights and defenses as a holder of an equivalent record or writing
8 under the Uniform Commercial Code, including, if the applicable statutory
9 requirements under the Uniform Commercial Code are satisfied, the rights and
10 defenses of a holder in due course, a holder to which a negotiable document of title
11 has been duly negotiated, or a purchaser, respectively. Delivery, possession, and
12 indorsement are not required to obtain or exercise any of the rights under this
13 subsection.
14 (e) Except as otherwise agreed, an obligor under a transferable record has
15 the same rights and defenses as an equivalent obligor under equivalent records or
16 writings under the Uniform Commercial Code.
17 (f) If requested by a person against which enforcement is sought, the person
18 seeking to enforce the transferable record shall provide reasonable proof that the
19 person is in control of the transferable record. Proof may include access to the
20 authoritative copy of the transferable record and related business records sufficient
21 to review the terms of the transferable record and to establish the identity of the
22 person having control of the transferable record.

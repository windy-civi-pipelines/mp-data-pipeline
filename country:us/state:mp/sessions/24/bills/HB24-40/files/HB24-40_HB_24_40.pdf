TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Session, 2025 H. B. 24-
A BILL FOR AN ACT
To amend Title 4 of the Commonwealth Code to clarify the
application of business registration, licensing, and tax laws to
foreign corporations engaged in land development,
infrastructure development, or construction activities in the
Commonwealth, including those related to development projects
performed under or in connection with contracts, subcontracts,
or agreements with the United States.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24TH NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Findings and Purpose. The Legislature finds that numerous off-
2 island companies have entered the Commonwealth to perform construction, land
3 development, infrastructure development, engineering, and other related
4 commercial services with funding provided by the United States government,
5 including the Department of Defense. Despite operating physically and
6 commercially in the CNMI, many of these entities fail to register with the CNMI
7 Registrar of Corporations, do not obtain business licenses, and do not comply with
8 local tax laws, such as the Developer Infrastructure Tax and the Gross Revenue
9 Tax. This has resulted in a pattern of noncompliance that undermines public

HOUSE BILL 24-41 0
1 revenue, distorts competition for local businesses, and weakens the
2 Commonwealth's ability to regulate its own economic development.
3 This pattern of noncompliance persists despite the existence of clear
4 statutory requirements. Under 4 CMC § 4291(k), a "foreign corporation" is defined
5 as a corporation for profit incorporated under a law other than the law of the
6 Commonwealth. Such corporations are required under 4 CMC § 4641 to obtain a
7 certificate of authority before transacting business in the CNMI. Additionally, 4
8 CMC § 5611 prohibits any person or entity from engaging in business without first
9 obtaining a CNMI business license. The Developer Infrastructure Tax Act, set forth
10 in 4 CMC §§ 1931-1939, further imposes a tax on land development to support
11 public infrastructure.
12 However, despite these statutory provisions, foreign corporation
13 compliance with local business and tax laws has remained inconsistent. The
14 existing statutes do not explicitly state that foreign corporations performing work
15 on federally funded development projects are engaging in business for purposes of
16 CNMI business registration, licensing, and taxation. This lack of specificity may
17 support off-island contractors' ostensible claims that they are exempt from
18 registering, obtaining business licenses, and paying taxes in the Commonwealth.
19 This Act clarifies and confirms that foreign corporations—those organized
20 under laws other than those of the Commonwealth—are deemed to be transacting
21 and engaging in business when they provide construction, infrastructure
2

HOUSE BILL 24- 1/L0
1 development, land development, engineering, logistical, or similar services in the
2 CNMI, even if such business is being conducted in connection with federally
3 funded contracts. This Act further clarifies that foreign corporations performing
4 construction, land development, or infrastructure development in the
5 Commonwealth are subject to existing corporate registration, business licensing,
6 and tax laws. It amends the Developer Infrastructure Tax Act to expressly apply
7 these requirements to such entities, and it revises corporate registration provisions
8 to reinforce the requirement that a foreign corporation must obtain a certificate of
9 authority prior to transacting business in the Commonwealth.
10 Importantly, nothing in this Act authorizes taxation of the United States
11 Government or its instrumentalities, consistent with Section 605 of the Covenant
12 to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union
13 with the United States of America and other applicable federal law. Rather, this Act
14 improves enforcement of business, licensing, and tax laws; protects the public
15 interest; and preserves the Commonwealth's authority over commercial activity
16 occurring within its borders.
17 Section 2. Amendment. Section 4641 of Article 1, Chapter 15, Part 2,
18 Division 4, Title 4 of the Commonwealth Code is hereby amended by inserting a
19 new subsection (d) to read as follows:

HOUSE BILL 24-410
1 "§ 4641. Authority to Transact Business Required.

16 employees or agents or otherwise, if the orders require acceptance
17 outside the Commonwealth before they become contracts;

19 in real or personal property;

3 and that is not one in the course of repeated transactions of a like

6 (c) The list of activities in subsection (b) of this section is not exhaustive.
7 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any foreign corporation that undertakes
8 construction, infrastructure development, land development,
9 engineering, or other related commercial services within the
10 Commonwealth, including, but not limited to, services related to public
11 infrastructure projects performed under or in connection with contracts,
12 subcontracts, or agreements with the United States, shall be deemed to
13 be transacting business in the Commonwealth for purposes of this
14 Section."
15 Section 3. Amendment. Section 5611 of Article 1, Chapter 6, Division 5,
16 Title 4 of the Commonwealth Code is hereby amended by inserting a new
17 subsection (j) to read as follows:
18 "§ 5611. Business License Fees.
19 (a) Business License Required. Before engaging in or continuing in a
20 business, a person shall first obtain from the Secretary of the
21 Department of Finance a license to engage in or conduct that business.

6 in connection with contracts, subcontracts, or agreements with the

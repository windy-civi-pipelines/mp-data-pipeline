TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
p-lem b-e---‘ 9, Xs-
(Scovil
Regular Session, 2025 H. B. 1 4+400
To safeguard the Commonwealth's landfill capacity, public
health, and environment by restricting the acceptance and
disposal of waste generated off-island unless certain health,
safety, and environmental conditions are met.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24TH NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Findings and Purpose. The Legislature finds that contractors
2 for the United States Department of Defense have recently sought to dispose of
3 large quantities of construction and demolition debris from the Republic of the
4 Marshall Islands as well as pharmaceutical waste from Guam in the
5 Commonwealth's landfills.
6 Under current practice, when such requests are made, the waste originator
7 must provide laboratory analysis demonstrating that the material is not hazardous.
8 If confirmed as non-hazardous, existing Commonwealth law does not explicitly
9 prohibit acceptance of the material for disposal within the Commonwealth. While
10 such acceptance may be technically permissible under present statutory language,
11 the practice poses serious risks and costs to the CNMI.
400

HOUSE BILL
1 First, landfill space in the CNMI is extremely limited, expensive to develop,
2 and intended to serve the disposal needs of residents and businesses in the Northern
3 Mariana Islands. Unrestricted importation of off-island waste would accelerate the
4 depletion of landfill capacity and increase long-term disposal costs for the local
5 community. The Legislature finds that waste disposal is typically a local
6 government function and that protecting remaining landfill capacity is crucial to
7 public welfare.
8 Second, even where initial testing indicates that imported waste is non-
9 hazardous, there remains a significant risk of contamination or hidden hazards in
10 the waste stream. Imported waste may contain invasive species or undisclosed
11 hazardous substances that could escape detection. Accepting such materials could
12 expose the CNMI to environmental harm and liability under federal law. The
13 Commonwealth lacks practical means to continuously monitor and verify the
14 composition of waste generated outside its jurisdiction to the same degree it
15 oversees locally generated waste. Thus, allowing solid waste from outside sources
16 into local facilities creates an undue risk to the Commonwealth's environment and
17 public health that cannot be adequately mitigated by ordinary inspection alone.
18 Third, the Legislature is concerned that accepting off-island waste without
19 the safeguards established by this Act would set a dangerous precedent, effectively
20 encouraging the Commonwealth to become a regional dumping ground. This would
2
_
HOUSE BILL 24. ' (00
1 undermine environmental protection efforts and public confidence in the
2 government's ability to manage waste responsibly.
3 At the same time, the Commonwealth may not adopt a categorical ban on
4 waste originating in other U.S. jurisdictions merely to reserve landfill capacity, as
5 such discrimination against interstate commerce likely violates the dormant
6 Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. And while the Covenant to
7 Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with
8 the United States of America affords the CNMI distinct authority with respect to
9 imports from outside the U.S. customs territory—subject to the United States'
10 international obligations—this Act advances legitimate health, safety, and capacity
11 objectives through even-handed standards that apply uniformly to all off-island
12 waste rather than origin-based prohibitions.
13 Accordingly, this Act is crafted to protect public health, safety, and the
14 environment by applying the Commonwealth's environmental safeguards to all
15 solid waste, while imposing additional, neutral conditions on imported waste to
16 address the unique risks of off-island disposal and the Commonwealth's limited
17 landfill capacity. These measures are carefully tailored to ensure that imported
18 waste is managed to at least the same standard as local waste, with further
19 safeguards justified by the distinct risks posed by the shipment and handling of
20 imported waste, uncertainties in its composition, and the added strain such disposal
21 places on the Commonwealth's finite landfill capacity. The Legislature further
3
-
24-Coo
HOUSE BILL
1 finds that any incidental burden on interstate commerce that these requirements
2 may impose is not clearly excessive in relation to the substantial local benefits they
3 provide, and no reasonable non-discriminatory alternative can adequately protect
4 the Commonwealth's landfill capacity and fragile environment and ecosystem. In
5 other words, requirements imposed by this Act, such as practicable-alternative
6 analysis, financial assurance, and cost-based impact fees, are not protectionist
7 measures but are instead neutral safeguards tailored to both mitigate the specific
8 risks of accepting and disposing off-island waste and to ensure that the costs and
9 liabilities of such waste are not unfairly shifted onto the people of the Northern
10 Mariana Islands. In this regard, the Legislature's intent is to lawfully safeguard the
11 Commonwealth's environment and landfill capacity consistent with the Commerce
12 Clause of the United States Constitution.
13 Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to explicitly restrict the acceptance of
14 solid waste originating outside the Commonwealth unless specified health, safety,
15 and environmental conditions are met. Narrow exceptions are provided for waste
16 streams that the Commonwealth is required to accept under federal law, for
17 materials imported solely for recycling or resource recovery (with no landfilling of
18 such materials), and for emergency situations declared by the Governor when no
19 reasonable alternative exists to protect public health or safety. In all other cases,
20 off-island waste may not be disposed of in Commonwealth landfills unless it has
21 been processed or handled to comply with the CNMI's environmental standards

1 and its acceptance will not harm the public interest. By closing the gap in current
2 law that has allowed importation of supposedly "non-hazardous" waste without
3 sufficient safeguards, this Act ensures that all solid waste—regardless of origin-
4 is managed under a framework that protects the Commonwealth's environment,
5 preserves scarce landfill capacity, and affirms the people's right to a clean and
6 healthful environment as guaranteed by Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution of
7 the Northern Mariana Islands.

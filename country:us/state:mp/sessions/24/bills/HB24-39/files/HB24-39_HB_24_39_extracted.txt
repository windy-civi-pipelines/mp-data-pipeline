Section 1:
TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Regular Session, 2025 H. B. 24- 'VI
To establish Treatment Program Enforcement Officers within the
Judiciary to carry out enforcement, supervision, and monitoring
functions essential to the success of court-supervised treatment
programs, and to ensure that these officers are fully recognized
as law enforcement personnel under Commonwealth law.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24TH NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Findings and Purpose. The Legislature finds that the Judiciary
2 of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands employs various law
3 enforcement personnel, including Conimunity Supervision Officers and
4 Compliance Officers under 1 CMC § 3207. These officers exclusively serve the
5 Drug Court and are authorized to supervise participants, conduct home and work
6 visits, perform drug testing, monitor compliance, and make arrests.
7 The Legislature further finds that similar enforcement and supervision
8 functions are necessary for other court-supervised treatment programs administered
9 by the Judiciary, such as the Mental Health Court Docket. These programs provide
10 rehabilitative services as an alternative to traditional criminal prosecution,
11 sentencing, or incarceration. Like Drug Court, these programs require robust
41
HOUSE BILL 24-
1 enforcement and participant monitoring to ensure accountability, public safety, and
2 successful rehabilitation.
3 However, current law limits Community Supervision Officers and
4 Compliance Officers to the Drug Court, creating a statutory gap that restricts the
5 Judiciary's ability to assign such officers to other court-supervised treatment
6 programs.
7 To address this gap, this Act reclassifies the Community Supervision
8 Officers and Compliance Officers as Treatment Program Enforcement Officers.
9 This reclassification preserves the core enforcement and supervision
10 responsibilities of the former positions while enabling the Judiciary to deploy these
11 officers not only within Drug Court but also across all court-supervised programs-
12 whether structured as a treatment docket or treatment court, and whether
13 established by statute, court rule, or judicial administrative order. Because
14 Community Supervision Officers and Compliance Officers are currently
15 recognized as law enforcement officers under various provisions of
16 Commonwealth law, this Act also updates those statutory references accordingly,
17 thereby maintaining officer benefits and responsibilities under the revised statutory
18 framework.
19 By creating this statutory framework and aligning key definitions, the
20 Commonwealth strengthens its capacity to deliver rehabilitative justice while
21 preserving public safety and maintaining officer accountability.

TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

To enact 4 CMC § 1208 and 4 CMC § 1312 to establish a Legal
Services and Access to Justice Tax Credit.

BE IT ENACTED BY THE NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Findings and Purpose. The Legislature finds that the
2 Commonwealth currently offers a tax credit incentive program for private and
3 corporate contributions to qualified educational institutions. These Education Tax
4 Credit statutes, codified under 4 CMC §§ 1205 and 1306, have successfully
5 encouraged support for public schools and nonprofit educational organizations.
6 These statutes demonstrate that well-structured tax incentives can help bridge
7 funding gaps and advance important public policy goals without requiring direct
8 appropriations from the General Fund.
9 The Legislature also finds that there is a critical and growing unmet need in
10 regards to access to civil legal services for low-income and underserved residents
11 of the Commonwealth. Every year, thousands of individuals and families in the
12 CNMI face legal issues involving housing, family relationships, immigration,
13 public benefits, consumer rights, and personal safety. Moreover, many of these

HOUSE BILL 24-
1 individuals cannot afford to hire legal counsel and are left to navigate complex legal
2 systems on their own, often resulting in denied rights, unresolved disputes, and
3 deepened economic and social hardship.
4 The Micronesian Legal Services Corporation (MLSC) is a nonprofit
5 501(c)(3) organization that provides free civil legal assistance in the CNMI.
6 MLSC's services cover a wide range of civil matters, including family law,
7 housing, consumer protection, employment rights, immigration, public benefits,
8 and victims' rights. All MLSC services are provided at no cost to individuals with
9 incomes at or below 125% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines. This eligibility
10 encompasses approximately 38% of the CNMI population, which is about 19,500
11 individuals.
12 Despite the clear public need for these services, MLSC's capacity is
13 severely limited. MLSC's Marianas Office operates with only three attorneys and
14 one paralegal, making it impossible to fully meet the needs of the eligible
15 population. While MLSC receives some federal funding and has occasionally been
16 awarded supplemental funds through local appropriations, these sources are
17 inconsistent and insufficient. As a result, the gap between the demand for free civil
18 legal services and MLSC's capacity continues to leave many residents without
19 meaningful access to justice.
20 The Legislature finds that access to competent, free or low-cost legal
21 services is essential to individual stability, community resilience, and the fair

HOUSE BILL 24- 2ii
1 administration of justice. Just as the Education Tax Credit empowers the public to
2 support educational institutions through designated tax contributions, the CNMI
3 ought to establish a similar mechanism to encourage private support for nonprofit
4 legal services organizations. A targeted tax credit for contributions to qualified
5 nonprofit legal services organizations would enable individuals and businesses to
6 help expand access to justice for indigent and underserved members of the
7 community.
8 Accordingly, the purpose of this legislation is to enact 4 CMC § 1208 and 4
9 CMC § 1312 for the purpose of establishing a Legal Services and Access to Justice
10 Tax Credit. This new credit is modeled on the Education Tax Credit but applies
11 specifically to qualifying nonprofit legal services organizations operating in the
12 Commonwealth. The credit will incentivize individuals and businesses to direct a
13 portion of their Wage and Salary, Earnings, and Gross Revenue Tax liability to
14 nonprofit legal services organizations, such as MLSC. By establishing this credit,
15 the Commonwealth creates a locally driven mechanism for public investment in
16 nonprofit legal services organizations that directly addresses the existing gap in
17 access to justice.

Section 1:
TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
29-0
Regular Session, 2025 H. B.
To adjust the 1992 salary cap of executive directors to a 2025
inflation-equivalent amount.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24TH NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Findings and Purpose. The Legislature finds that the executive-
2 level salary cap of $70,000 under 1 CMC § 8246, set more than three decades ago,
3 has not kept pace with inflation and no longer provides the purchasing power
4 originally intended. This erosion of real-dollar value risks discouraging qualified
5 candidates and undermines the statute's purpose. Addressing this issue requires
6 using a reliable and professionally accepted measure of inflation to convert the
7 1992 salary figure into a present-day equivalent.
8 The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), which is
9 compiled monthly by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, is the nation's most
10 widely accepted inflation gauge. In Manibusan v. Larson, 2018 MP 7, the CNMI
11 Supreme Court cited the Analysis of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of the
12 Northern Mariana Islands to confirm that both a professionally prepared CNMI-
13 specific CPI and the nationwide CPI-U qualify as acceptable composite price

1 indices. However, because the CNMI-specific CPI does not offer continuous data
2 back to 1992, the CPI-U represents the only complete and verifiable measure for
3 the entire period. Given its comprehensiveness and judicial recognition, the CPI-U
4 is the most appropriate benchmark for recalibrating executive-level salaries.
5 Although Manibusan specifically addressed legislative compensation, its
6 acceptance of the CPI-U highlights the index's reliability and broader applicability
7 as a transparent and professionally recognized measure of inflation. Applying this
8 CPI-based method to executive-level salaries therefore ensures consistency,
9 objectivity, and fiscal responsibility throughout the government, in line with the
10 Legislature's original intent.
11 To determine the 2025 equivalent of the 1992 salary, the Legislature first
12 identifies the CPI-U annual average for 1992 (140.3) and the most recent CPI-U
13 figure as of June 2025 (322.561). Dividing the 2025 index by the 1992 index yields
14 an inflation factor of approximately 2.299 (322.561 ± 140.3). Multiplying the
15 original $70,000 salary by this factor results in approximately $160,936 ($70,000
16 x 2.299). Rounding to the nearest thousand for budgeting clarity gives a target
17 figure of $161,000. In other words, consumer prices have risen by roughly 2.3 times
18 since 1992, requiring salaries to increase proportionally to maintain the same
19 purchasing power today. The figure of $161,000 thus represents the current
20 equivalent of the original $70,000 cap established in 1992.
21 Importantly, this adjustment does not mandate any immediate increase in

1 pay. It merely updates the statutory ceiling, allowing—but not requiring—boards
2 and agencies to revise executive compensation within the revised salary range.
3 Each corporation or autonomous entity retains full discretion to determine whether
4 and when to adjust compensation based on its own budgetary constraints,
5 performance policies, and organizational needs.
6 Accordingly, this Act adjusts the salary cap established in 1 CMC § 8246
7 from $70,000 to $161,000 to restore the purchasing power originally intended by
8 the Eighth Northern Marianas Commonwealth Legislature.
9 Section 2. Amendment. Section 8246 of Chapter 4, Part 2, Division 8, Title
10 1 of the Commonwealth Code is hereby amended to read as follows:
11 "§ 8246. Compensation of the Executive Directors of Government
12 Corporations, Semiautonomous and Autonomous Agencies.
13 The executive directors (the top administrative officers) of government
14 corporations, as defined in 1 CMC § 7103(n), and of other agencies,
15 commissions, and offices shall receive an annual salary of not less than
16 $48,000 and not more than $70,000 $160,000 as determined by the
17 applicable boards based on duties and responsibilities of such agencies.
18 Provided further that no executive director, or no top administrative
19 officer, of the agency shall be paid a contract buyout in the event the
20 employment of the executive director or the top administrative officer is
21 terminated before the end of the contract term."

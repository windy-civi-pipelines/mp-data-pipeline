Section 1:
TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Regular Session, 2025
To establish mandatory consecutive sentencing for repeat
felony offenders on probation or parole, and to ensure
consistent application of sentencing laws.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24Th NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Findings and Purpose. The Legislature finds that public safety
2 and trust in the criminal justice system are undermined when individuals with
3 repeated felony convictions continue to reoffend, even after being granted
4 opportunities for rehabilitation through probation or parole.
5 Under the existing legal framework, a person convicted of a felony may
6 receive a suspended execution of sentence under 6 CMC § 4105 or a suspended
7 imposition of sentence under 6 CMC § 4113, and be placed on probation. If such
8 individuals violate the terms of their probation, courts retain discretion to revoke or
9 modify the suspended sentence. In cases where a new offense is committed, a
10 portion of the suspended sentence may be reimposed, and the court retains
11 discretion to determine whether the prior and new sentences run concurrently or
12 consecutively. Similarly, parolees who commit new offenses during their term of
HOUSE BILL
1 supervision may be subject to new criminal charges, but the original sentence for
2 which parole was granted is not automatically reimposed and may be served
3 concurrently with the new sentence.
4 The Legislature finds that this discretionary model is insufficient to deter
5 habitual offenders, particularly where it allows individuals with multiple felony
6 convictions to face fragmented or lenient sentencing outcomes. This contributes to
7 a public perception that the criminal justice system fails to impose meaningful or
8 escalating consequences for repeat criminal behavior. In cases where a person
9 commits a third or subsequent felony while on probation or parole for a second or
10 subsequent felony, the potential for rehabilitation is significantly diminished, and
11 the need for accountability and public protection becomes more urgent.
12 To address this concern, and to enhance public confidence in the criminal
13 justice system, the Legislature finds it necessary to strengthen sentencing
14 requirements for repeat felony offenders. This Act establishes a mandatory
15 framework under which, upon a third felony conviction—when the offender was
16 on probation or parole for a second or later felony at the time the new offense was
17 committed—the court must reimpose the full suspended sentence from the prior
18 conviction and order it to be served consecutively to the sentence for the new
19 felony. This Act amends 6 CMC § 4105 to reflect this mandate and provides a
20 definition of "felony conviction" consistent with existing sentencing law, excluding
21 convictions for which the individual was unconditionally discharged more than ten
- 2 -
241- 2s-
HOUSE BILL
1 years prior to the commission of the new offense.
2 Additionally, this Act amends 6 CMC § 4104 to require that courts inform
3 defendants that a future felony committed while under probation or parole for a
4 prior felony will result in the full reimposition of the prior sentence, to be served
5 consecutively. It also amends 6 CMC § 4284 to ensure that the same rule applies
6 when the individual is on parole instead of probation. Further, the Act amends 6
7 CMC § 4113 to provide that where a defendant on probation under a suspended
8 imposition of sentence for a second or subsequent felony is convicted of a new
9 felony, the court must impose a sentence for the prior offense and require that it be
10 served consecutively to the new sentence.
11 To ensure internal consistency within the affected provisions, this Act also
12 includes a technical amendment to 6 CMC § 4113(i) to correct a citation to a cross-
13 referenced statute and to clarify that, in cases where probation is revoked for
14 noncompliance with conditions such as payment of restitution or participation in
15 counseling, the court may impose sentencing as described in subsections (f) and
16 (g). Currently, subsection (i) references subsection (e), which is unrelated to
17 sentencing.
18 Last, to avoid any ambiguity regarding the scope of this Act, the Legislature
19 clarifies that the enhanced sentencing provisions shall apply only to felony offenses
20 committed on or after the effective date of this Act. However, prior felony
21 convictions, regardless of when they occurred, may be used to trigger the
- 3 -
2 it- 2s-
HOUSE BELL
1 sentencing provisions of this Act, provided they meet the statutory criteria—such
2 as falling within the ten-year lookback period and qualifying as felonies under
3 Commonwealth law or their equivalent in another jurisdiction. This ensures the
4 Act's application is prospective while honoring its deterrent and accountability
5 objectives.
6 Through these targeted amendments, this Act ensures that repeat felony
7 offenders face clear and predictable consequences for continued criminal behavior.
8 By eliminating judicial discretion to impose concurrent sentences in the context of
9 third felony convictions committed while under supervised release, the Act
10 reinforces the seriousness of committing multiple criminal offenses, promotes
11 accountability, and supports the integrity of the sentencing, probation, and parole
12 systems. In doing so, this Act protects public safety, deters recidivism, and restores
13 public confidence in the fairness and consistency of the Commonwealth's criminal
14 justice system.
15 Section 2. Amendment. Section 4104 of Chapter 1, Division 4, Title 6 of
16 the Commonwealth Code is hereby amended to add subsection (f) to read as
17 follows:
18 "(f) The sentencing court shall inform the defendant that should the
19 defendant be convicted of a new felony offense while on probation or

1 (1) If the court, pursuant to subsection (h) above, is required to impose
2 any sentence that could have been lawfully imposed at the time of
3 conviction, the court shall first provide the defendant an
4 opportunity to be heard on the record regarding whether the
5 statutory criteria for sentencing imposition have been met,
6 including but not limited to: whether the prior conviction qualifies
7 as a felony conviction, whether the defendant was on probation or
8 parole for a second or subsequent felony at the time of the new
9 offense, and whether ten or more years have elapsed between the
10 unconditional discharge from the prior conviction and the
11 commission of the new offense. The defendant shall have the right
12 to counsel at this proceeding. The court shall make express findings
13 on the record as to each applicable criterion prior to ordering that a
14 sentence may be imposed and served consecutively.
15 (2) When a probation violation is established by a judgment of
16 conviction on a new criminal charge, no additional adjudication of
17 the violation is required. However, before imposing sentence for
18 the offense previously subject to suspended imposition, the court
19 shall conduct a sentencing hearing at which the defendant shall
20 have the right to be represented by counsel, to be heard in
21 mitigation, to present relevant evidence, and to make a personal

1 statement to the court. The court shall determine and pronounce
2 sentence in open court, stating its reasons on the record.
3 (i) If the court finds a violation of probation based on the probationer's
4 failure to perform any special condition of probation, pay restitution,
5 fees or fines, participate in counseling, or perform community work
6 service, a conviction of record shall enter, and the court may impose
7 sentence as described in §§. 4113(e)L0=fg)., and may, in addition,
8 extend the period of probation up to the maximum period allowable by
9 law for the crime for which the probationer was granted suspended
10 imposition, in order to ensure compliance with the conditions
11 originally imposed. Before finding a violation of probation based on
12 the failure to pay restitution, fees, or fines, the Court must find by a
13 preponderance of the evidence that the probationer has made no efforts
14 to pay and has the ability to do so.

Section 1:
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
SESSION, 2025 H. L. B. 24- °Of
A LOCAL BILL FOR AN ACT
FOR THE THIRD SENATORIAL DISTRICT
To establish the "Saipan Economic Incentive Zone" within the Third Senatorial
District, and to authorize the Commonwealth Economic Incentive Authority and
other relevant agencies to administer and regulate investment activities within the
designated zone.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE THIRD SENATORIAL DISTRICT
DELEGATION PURSUANT TO CHAPTER 4, DIVISION 1, TITLE 1 OF
THE COMMONWEALTH CODE:
1 SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
2 This Act may be cited as the "Saipan Economic Incentive Zone Act of
3 2025."
4 SECTION 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
5 Zoning within the Third Senatorial District must be grounded in deliberate
6 legislative policy that takes into account the needs of both the private sector and the
7 Third Senatorial District. The Saipan and Northern Islands Delegation (SNILD)
8 finds that large tracts of public and developable land in Saipan remain underutilized
9 despite proximity to ports, utilities, and transportation corridors capable of
HOUSE LOCAL BILL
1 supporting commerce. To unlock these assets responsibly, the SNILD determines
2 that clear geographic boundaries for an economic incentive zone must be
3 established by law to guide future investment and protect public interest.
4 Organized economic growth depends on coherent coordination among
5 Commonwealth institutions. The Commonwealth Economic Incentive Authority
6 (ETA), established under Title 4, Division 5, Chapter 14 of the Commonwealth
7 Code, possesses the statutory capacity to license and monitor qualified projects,
8 while the Department of Public Lands (DPL), Commonwealth Ports Authority
9 (CPA), and Bureau of Environmental and Coastal Quality (BECQ) retain
10 operational jurisdictions that affect development. The SNILD finds that these
11 agencies can perform their existing functions more effectively when operating
12 within legislatively defined zones, ensuring lawful, transparent, and accountable
13 administration.
14 Neighboring privately owned properties that border the public lands
15 designated as part of the Saipan Economic Incentive Zone may also participate in
16 districtwide growth. The Economic Incentive Authority may develop regulations
17 to evaluate petitions from adjacent private landowners seeking inclusion, provided
18 that any such inclusion maintains consistency with land-use integrity, market
19 fairness, and environmental stewardship, and does not alter the zone's boundaries
20 except as expressly permitted by law.
21 Empowerment through this Act solidifies the Legislature's policy objective:

HOUSE LOCAL BILL
1 to define the Saipan Economic Incentive Zone by statute and to assign
2 administrative implementation to the Commonwealth's existing economic, land,
3 and environmental agencies. By fixing the zone boundaries through legislation, the
4 Commonwealth strengthens predictability for investors, safeguards constitutional
5 land protections, and establishes a framework that balances development with
6 responsible governance for the benefit of the people of the Third Senatorial District.
7 SECTION 3. ENACTMENT.

9 Islands of the Commonwealth Code is hereby amended by adding a new Chapter

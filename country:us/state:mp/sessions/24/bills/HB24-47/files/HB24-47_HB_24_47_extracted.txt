Section 1:
TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
eyq
Regular Session, 2025 H. B. 24-
To realign the authority and duties of the CNMI Department of
Labor; and for other purposes.
11
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24T NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Short Title: This Act may be referred to as the "Commonwealth
2 Labor Conformity Act of 2025".
3 Section 2. Findings and Purpose: The Legislature finds that the CNMI
4 Department of Labor ("Department") has undergone multiple reorganizations,
5 resulting in unclear statutory authority and regulatory inconsistencies. The
6 Department was originally established in 1978 as the Department of Commerce and
7 Labor under Public Law 1-8. Subsequently, Executive Order 94-3 restructured it as
8 the Department of Labor and Immigration. However, following the passage of the
9 Consolidated Natural Resources Act (CNRA) of 2008, immigration functions were
10 transferred to the federal government, and the Department was renamed the
11 Department of Labor under Executive Order 2003-1. These successive changes
12 have left gaps in the Department's statutory framework, causing uncertainty
13 regarding its duties and jurisdiction.
In
HOUSE BILL 24-
1 In recognition of this issue, Public Law 15-108 and Public Law 17-01 were
2 enacted to repeal outdated provisions and realign the Department's authority.
3 Public Law 17-01, in particular, amended Public Law 15-108 to remove references
4 to immigration functions and clarify that the CNMI' s labor laws must align with
5 federal jurisdiction over immigration. However, despite these efforts, regulatory
6 language and enforcement mechanisms remain inconsistent. Here we are, 15 years
7 later, and regulatory issues related to immigration language still persist. This has
8 led to confusion in the enforcement of labor regulations and the role of the
9 Department in overseeing employment matters within the Commonwealth.
10 The Legislature reaffirms that all employers and workers in the
11 Commonwealth must comply with both federal and CNMI law. The purpose of this
12 Act is to further refine and clarify the statutory authority of the Department,
13 ensuring that its duties are properly aligned with labor and employment
14 enforcement while eliminating outdated references to immigration functions that
15 are no longer within its jurisdiction. By repealing and replacing Public Laws 15-
16 108 and 17-01, this measure will provide clear guidance on the Department's
17 authority, strengthen enforcement mechanisms, and ensure that CNMI labor
18 regulations are current, effective, and consistent with applicable laws.

BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24T NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Short Title: This Act may be referred to as the "Commonwealth
2 Labor Conformity Act of 2025".
3 Section 2. Findings and Purpose: The Legislature finds that the CNMI
4 Department of Labor ("Department") has undergone multiple reorganizations,
5 resulting in unclear statutory authority and regulatory inconsistencies. The
6 Department was originally established in 1978 as the Department of Commerce and
7 Labor under Public Law 1-8. Subsequently, Executive Order 94-3 restructured it as
8 the Department of Labor and Immigration. However, following the passage of the
9 Consolidated Natural Resources Act (CNRA) of 2008, immigration functions were
10 transferred to the federal government, and the Department was renamed the
11 Department of Labor under Executive Order 2003-1. These successive changes
12 have left gaps in the Department's statutory framework, causing uncertainty
13 regarding its duties and jurisdiction.

In
HOUSE BILL 24-
1 In recognition of this issue, Public Law 15-108 and Public Law 17-01 were
2 enacted to repeal outdated provisions and realign the Department's authority.
3 Public Law 17-01, in particular, amended Public Law 15-108 to remove references
4 to immigration functions and clarify that the CNMI' s labor laws must align with
5 federal jurisdiction over immigration. However, despite these efforts, regulatory
6 language and enforcement mechanisms remain inconsistent. Here we are, 15 years
7 later, and regulatory issues related to immigration language still persist. This has
8 led to confusion in the enforcement of labor regulations and the role of the
9 Department in overseeing employment matters within the Commonwealth.
10 The Legislature reaffirms that all employers and workers in the
11 Commonwealth must comply with both federal and CNMI law. The purpose of this
12 Act is to further refine and clarify the statutory authority of the Department,
13 ensuring that its duties are properly aligned with labor and employment
14 enforcement while eliminating outdated references to immigration functions that
15 are no longer within its jurisdiction. By repealing and replacing Public Laws 15-
16 108 and 17-01, this measure will provide clear guidance on the Department's
17 authority, strengthen enforcement mechanisms, and ensure that CNMI labor
18 regulations are current, effective, and consistent with applicable laws.

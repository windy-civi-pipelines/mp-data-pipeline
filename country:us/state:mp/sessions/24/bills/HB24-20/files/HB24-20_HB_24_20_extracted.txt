Section 1:
TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Session, 2025 H. B. 24- 2,IA
To require conspicuous warning labels be placed on all betel nut
products and containers that are imported or sold in the CNMI.

BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24T NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Findings and Purpose.
2 Federal law establishes labeling requirements on certain consumer products
3 that are carcinogenic or hazardous to one's health. For example, the Family
4 Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act gives the Food and Drug
5 Administration (FDA) the power to regulate the tobacco industry, particularly in
6 regards to the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products.
7 Indeed, in March 2020, FDA finalized the "Required Warnings for Cigarette
8 Packages and Advertisements" rule, establishing eleven new cigarette health
9 warnings—each featuring a textual warning accompanied by a photorealistic image
10 illustrating the dangers of smoking.
11 Additionally, the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act and
12 related regulations impose strict requirements on the manufacture, marketing, and
HOUSE BILL 24- X.0
1 distribution of tobacco products, ensuring that consumers are fully informed of the
2 associated health risks. These regulations require that cigarette packaging
3 prominently display color graphics and warning statements illustrating the dangers
4 of smoking. Warnings such as "WARNING: Tobacco smoke can harm your
5 children" and "WARNING: Smoking causes fatal lung disease in
6 nonsmokers" must occupy the top 50% of the front and rear panels of all cigarette
7 packages. The law also mandates that these warnings be conspicuously placed,
8 clearly visible beneath any clear wrapping, and accurately reproduced as approved
9 by the FDA.
10 The Legislature finds that areca nut (commonly known as betel nut)
11 contains a confirmed carcinogen, and its sale, packaging, and distribution should
12 be subject to similar labeling and warning requirements as other carcinogenic
13 consumer products, like tobacco. Yet, despite betel nut containing a known
14 carcinogen, betel nut products sold in the CNMI currently lack any warning labels,
15 leaving consumers uninformed about the serious health risks associated with its
16 use.
17 This Act establishes mandatory labeling requirements for all betel nut
18 products sold, distributed, or imported in the CNMI. It prohibits the sale of any
19 betel nut product that does not display clear health warnings about the risks of
20 arecoline, a known carcinogen. It requires that warning labels be directly placed on
21 each betel nut package and retail container in a prominent, highly visible manner.
2
HOUSE BILL 24-tO
1 To prevent desensitization and reinforce awareness of health risks, two distinct
2 warning labels must be used on a rotating basis—one label during the first half of
3 the year and the other during the second half. This semi-annual rotation ensures that
4 consumers are consistently presented with differing warning designs. Additionally,
5 this Act ties the issuance and renewal of the betel nut license established under 4
6 CMC § 51904 to businesses' compliance with these requirements. Last, it
7 authorizes the CNMI Department of Commerce to regulate betel nut labeling and
8 enforce the requirements established herein.
9 The Legislature recognizes that the implementation of labeling
10 requirements may impose additional costs on retailers and importers. In response
11 to these concerns, nonprofit organizations, such as the Commonwealth Cancer
12 Association, have expressed support for this Act and have offered to print and
13 provide the required labels to the Department of Commerce for distribution to
14 licensees at no cost. The Commonwealth Cancer Association has further indicated
15 that it would enter into a two-year agreement to supply these labels free of charge,
16 acknowledging the financial burden that sticker production and placement may
17 place on businesses. Their commitment ensures that compliance with this Act will
18 not create an undue economic hardship on retailers and importers while still
19 advancing public health objectives.
20 To track the effectiveness of the labeling requirements and to support any
21 nonprofit organizations involved in this public health initiative, this Act requires
3
-
HOUSE BILL 24-2)
1 retailers to track the number of betel nut products sold on a monthly basis. Retailers
2 must maintain records of each betel nut product transaction and submit these
3 records to the Department of Commerce by the 5th business day of each month.
4 The Department will then use this data to identify gaps in label compliance and
5 assess whether the labels have had their intended impact on consumer behavior.
6 The reported information will also assist nonprofit organizations in determining
7 how many labels should be created and donated to the Department. Last, this Act
8 authorizes the Department of Commerce to share this information with the CNMI
9 Department of Public Health and the Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation to
10 help inform their public health policies and initiatives. All data submitted by
11 retailers will be treated as confidential and used solely for the purposes outlined
12 within this Act.
13 By implementing these labeling requirements, this Act ensures that
14 consumers in the CNMI are fully informed about the significant health risks
15 associated with betel nut use. Just as federal regulations mandate clear and
16 conspicuous warnings for tobacco products, this Act establishes similar protections
17 for betel nut consumers, reinforcing public awareness and promoting informed
18 decision-making. Through labeling standards, regulatory oversight, and
19 enforcement mechanisms, this legislation aims to reduce public health risks and
20 provide betel nut users with the same level of consumer protection that is extended
21 to other similar carcinogenic products.

HOUSE BILL 24-Z

HOUSE BILL 24-2)
1 retailers to track the number of betel nut products sold on a monthly basis. Retailers
2 must maintain records of each betel nut product transaction and submit these
3 records to the Department of Commerce by the 5th business day of each month.
4 The Department will then use this data to identify gaps in label compliance and
5 assess whether the labels have had their intended impact on consumer behavior.
6 The reported information will also assist nonprofit organizations in determining
7 how many labels should be created and donated to the Department. Last, this Act
8 authorizes the Department of Commerce to share this information with the CNMI
9 Department of Public Health and the Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation to
10 help inform their public health policies and initiatives. All data submitted by
11 retailers will be treated as confidential and used solely for the purposes outlined
12 within this Act.
13 By implementing these labeling requirements, this Act ensures that
14 consumers in the CNMI are fully informed about the significant health risks
15 associated with betel nut use. Just as federal regulations mandate clear and
16 conspicuous warnings for tobacco products, this Act establishes similar protections
17 for betel nut consumers, reinforcing public awareness and promoting informed
18 decision-making. Through labeling standards, regulatory oversight, and
19 enforcement mechanisms, this legislation aims to reduce public health risks and
20 provide betel nut users with the same level of consumer protection that is extended
21 to other similar carcinogenic products.

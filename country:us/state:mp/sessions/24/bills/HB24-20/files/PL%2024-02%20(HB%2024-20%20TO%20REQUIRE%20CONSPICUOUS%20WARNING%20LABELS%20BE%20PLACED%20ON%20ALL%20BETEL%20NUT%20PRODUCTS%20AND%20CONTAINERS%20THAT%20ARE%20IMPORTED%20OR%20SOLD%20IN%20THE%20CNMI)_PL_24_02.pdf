TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
FIRST DAY, FIRST SPECIAL SESSION
APRIL 24, 2025
H. B. No. 24-20
AN ACT
To REQUIRE CONSPICUOUS WARNING LABELS BE PLACED ON
ALL BETEL NUT PRODUCTS AND CONTAINERS THAT ARE
IMPORTED OR SOLD IN THE CNMI.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN
MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.
2 Federal law establishes labeling requirements on certain consumer products
3 that are carcinogenic or hazardous to one's health. For example, the Family
4 Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act gives the Food and Drug
5 Administration (FDA) the power to regulate the tobacco industry, particularly in
6 regards to the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products.
7 Indeed, in March 2020, FDA finalized the "Required Warnings for Cigarette
8 Packages and Advertisements" rule, establishing eleven new cigarette health
9 warnings—each featuring a textual warning accompanied by a photorealistic
10 image illustrating the dangers of smoking.
11 Additionally, the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act and
12 related regulations impose strict requirements on the manufacture, marketing,

Public Law No. 24-02
HOUSE BILL 24-20
1 and distribution of tobacco products, ensuring that consumers are fully informed
2 of the associated health risks. These regulations require that cigarette packaging
3 prominently display color graphics and warning statements illustrating the
4 dangers of smoking. Warnings such as "WARNING: Tobacco smoke can harm
5 your children" and "WARNING: Smoking causes fatal lung disease in
6 nonsmokers" must occupy the top 50% of the front and rear panels of all cigarette
7 packages. The law also mandates that these warnings be conspicuously placed,
8 clearly visible beneath any clear wrapping, and accurately reproduced as
9 approved by the FDA.
10 The Legislature finds that areca nut (commonly known as betel nut)
11 contains a confirmed carcinogen, and its sale, packaging, and distribution should
12 be subject to similar labeling and warning requirements as other carcinogenic
13 consumer products, like tobacco. Yet, despite betel nut containing a known
14 carcinogen, betel nut products sold in the CNMI currently lack any warning
15 labels, leaving consumers uninformed about the serious health risks associated
16 with its use.
17 This Act establishes mandatory labeling requirements for all betel nut
18 products sold, distributed, or imported in the CNMI. It prohibits the sale of any
19 betel nut product that does not display clear health warnings about the risks of
20 arecoline, a known carcinogen. It requires that warning labels be directly placed
21 on each betel nut package and retail container in a prominent, highly visible
22 manner. To prevent desensitization and reinforce awareness of health risks, two
23 distinct warning labels must be used on a rotating basis—one label during the
24 first half of the year and the other during the second half. This semi-annual
25 rotation ensures that consumers are consistently presented with differing
26 warning designs. Additionally, this Act ties the issuance and renewal of the betel
27 nut license established under 4 CMC § 51904 to businesses' compliance with
28 these requirements. Last, it authorizes the CNMI Department of Commerce to
29 regulate betel nut labeling and enforce the requirements established herein.
2

Public Law No. 24-02
HOUSE BILL 24-20
1 The Legislature recognizes that the implementation of labeling
2 requirements may impose additional costs on retailers and importers. In response
3 to these concerns, nonprofit organizations, such as the Commonwealth Cancer
4 Association, have expressed support for this Act and have offered to print and
5 provide the required labels to the Department of Commerce for distribution to
6 licensees at no cost. The Commonwealth Cancer Association has further indicated
7 that it would enter into a two-year agreement to supply these labels free of
8 charge, acknowledging the financial burden that sticker production and
9 placement may place on businesses. Their commitment ensures that compliance
10 with this Act will not create an undue economic hardship on retailers and
11 importers while still advancing public health objectives.
12 To track the effectiveness of the labeling requirements and to support any
13 nonprofit organizations involved in this public health initiative, this Act requires
14 retailers to track the number of betel nut products sold on a monthly basis.
15 Retailers must maintain records of each betel nut product transaction and submit
16 these records to the Department of Commerce by the 5th business day of each
17 month. The Department will then use this data to identify gaps in label
18 compliance and assess whether the labels have had their intended impact on
19 consumer behavior. The reported information will also assist nonprofit
20 organizations in determining how many labels should be created and donated to
21 the Department. Last, this Act authorizes the Department of Commerce to share
22 this information with the CNMI Department of Public Health and the
23 Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation to help inform their public health
24 policies and initiatives. All data submitted by retailers will be treated as
25 confidential and used solely for the purposes outlined within this Act.
26 By implementing these labeling requirements, this Act ensures that
27 consumers in the CNMI are fully informed about the significant health risks
28 associated with betel nut use. Just as federal regulations mandate clear and
29 conspicuous warnings for tobacco products, this Act establishes similar
3

Public Law No. 24-02
HOUSE BILL 24-20
1 protections for betel nut consumers, reinforcing public awareness and promoting
2 informed decision-making. Through labeling standards, regulatory oversight, and
3 enforcement mechanisms, this legislation aims to reduce public health risks and
4 provide betel nut users with the same level of consumer protection that is
5 extended to other similar carcinogenic products.
6 SECTION 2. AMENDMENT.
7 Section 51902 of Chapter 19, Division 5, Title 4 of the Commonwealth Code
8 is hereby amended to read as follows:

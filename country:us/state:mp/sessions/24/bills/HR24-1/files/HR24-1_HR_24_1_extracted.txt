b. Determine whether there is a legitimate medical explanation for the result, including
legally prescribed medication.
c. Request, as needed, pertinent analytical records or require re-analysis of any specimen
to verify results.
d. Determine, when necessary, that there is clinical evidence, in addition to the urine test,

the presence of 6-monoacetylmorphine.

Section 249:
3. Fit for Work Consultation--The MRO or local consulting physician will, when

evaluation.
B. Release of Results
Drug test results will be released only under the following circumstances:

drug, the MRO is not required to take further action.
b. Based on a review of laboratory inspection reports, quality assurance and quality control
data, and other drug test results, the MRO may conclude that a particular drug test result is

10
Adopted: 1/13/2025
RULES OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TWENTY-FOURTH LEGISLATURE

Section 257:
SECTION 109. REFERRAL FOR TESTING
A. Pre-Employment/Post-Offer Testing
All offers of House of Representatives employment for safety-sensitive positions covered
by this Policy are contingent upon the applicant successfully passing a urine drug test, and no
applicant may be assigned to work until he or she has passed the test. Pre-employment/post-offer
drug testing shall be limited to testing for cocaine, marijuana, opiates, amphetamines, and
phencyclidine. Pre-employment/post-offer breath alcohol testing is prohibited for applicants.

Section 258:
1. Notification of Testing Requirement. Applicants shall be notified of the requirement
to pass a drug test at the time of application.

Section 259:
2. Test Specimens. All applicants being hired for safety-sensitive positions shall take a
urine drug test for illegal drugs.

Section 260:

testing.

Section 261:
4. Reapplication after a Positive Test
a. Applicants who test positive and cannot adequately explain the positive results will not
be considered for employment until the next available position and must present proof of wellness.
b. Any applicant for a safety-sensitive position who previously has been employed by the
House of Representatives shall provide a written release of drug and alcohol testing history for the
two years prior to the application date. No applicant who has previously tested positive for drugs
or alcohol may be permitted to perform a safety-sensitive job until released for work by an SAP

B. Reasonable Suspicion Testing
All employees shall be subject to drug/alcohol testing if there is reasonable suspicion to
believe he or she may be under the influence of illegal drugs or alcohol. Reasonable suspicion drug
testing shall be limited to testing for cocaine, marijuana, opiates, amphetamines, phencyclidine,
benzodiazepines, methaqualone, meperidine (Demerol), and barbiturates.

Section 262:
1. Reasonable Suspicion Defined. Reasonable suspicion for drug/alcohol testing means
specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations concerning the appearance, behavior, speech,
or body odors of the individual. A reasonable suspicion decision must be based on specific facts,
circumstances, physical evidence, physical signs and symptoms, or a pattern of performance and/or
behavior that would cause a trained supervisor to reasonably conclude that the individual may have
engaged in on the job illegal drug or alcohol use or may be under the influence of alcohol or illegal
drugs.
11
Adopted: 1/13/2025
RULES OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TWENTY-FOURTH LEGISLATURE

Section 263:
2. Steps in Reasonable Suspicion Testing
a. Objective Inquiry. When reasonable suspicion exists, the affected individual will be
questioned and observed. A decision to request a specimen shall be based on eye witness reports,
facts of the event, and observed physical and behavioral characteristics of the individual. The
individual shall be interviewed in a private area.
b. Verification. No individual shall be required to submit to a reasonable suspicion
drug/alcohol test unless the need for the test is verified by a second House of Representatives
supervisor who has received training in recognition of signs and symptoms of drug and alcohol
abuse. The required verification shall be done in person.
c. Duty Pending Test Results. Until the results of the drug/alcohol test are complete and
verified, no employee tested based upon reasonable suspicion shall be allowed to perform or
continue to perform a safety-sensitive function.
d. Transportation Assistance. The individual shall be accompanied to the collection site by
a supervisor or manager, and shall be provided transportation home from the collection site. If the
individual refuses and demands to drive his/her vehicle, the supervisor or manager shall notify the
Department of Public Safety.
e. Report. The events leading to a reasonable suspicion test will be reduced to writing and
will be reviewed by the Speaker or his or her designee. This report shall be considered confidential
and will be maintained in a separate confidential file until utilized in disciplinary action, in which
case it will be filed in the employee's Official Personnel Folder.
C. Post-Accident/Incident Testing
All employees shall be subject to drug/alcohol testing if an accident/incident occurs that
meets the definitions of Section 102 (A). Post-accident/incident drug testing shall be limited to
testing for cocaine, marijuana, opiates, amphetamines, phencyclidine, benzodiazepines,
methaqualone, meperidine (Demerol), and barbiturates. If an accident/incident causes severe life
disabling injury or may cause substantial liability to House of Representatives, a blood sample
may be drawn for future testing if breath alcohol testing is not readily available.

Section 264:
1. Persons Subject to Post-Accident/Incident Testing.
a. The driver of any House vehicle or operator of any House equipment involved in an
accident/incident shall be tested.
b. Each employee whose action or inaction contributed to the accident/incident or whose
action cannot be completely discounted as a contributing factor to the accident/incident (as
determined by using the best information available at the time of the decision) shall be tested.
12
Adopted: 1/13/2025
RULES OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TWENTY-FOURTH LEGISLATURE

Section 265:
2. Test Specimens. Every effort shall be made to collect specimens as soon as practical
following an accident/incident. However, nothing should prevent an injured person from receiving
necessary medical treatment and/or being interviewed by investigating officers/personnel.

Section 266:
3. Duty Pending Test Results. Until the results of the drug/alcohol test are complete and
verified, no employee tested shall be allowed to perform or continue to perform a safety-sensitive
function; provided, however, that an employee may be allowed to perform or continue to perform
a safety-sensitive function, pending the results, if the supervisor reasonably believes that the
employee was not under the influence at the time of the accident/incident.

Section 267:
4. Delayed Reporting of Accident/Incidents. An employee who delays the reporting of
an accident/incident, which could have resulted in a drug or alcohol test, beyond the scheduled
work shift shall be regarded as refusing to be tested.
D. Return to Duty Testing (Re-entry to Work) and Follow-up Testing

Section 268:
1. Return to Duty Testing Criteria. An employee in a non-safety sensitive position,
having previously tested positive for drugs or alcohol or having voluntarily acknowledged being
under the influence of drugs or alcohol while on duty, other than as specified in Section 104 (C) (3)
and (4) will be required to pass a drug/alcohol test before being returned to duty. These employees
will not be allowed to return to work until they: (1) Test negative for cocaine, marijuana, opiates,
amphetamines, phencyclidine, benzodiazepines, methaqualone, meperidine (Demerol), and
barbiturates, and are evaluated and released for duty by the MRO (if the prior incident was drug
related); or (2) Test at 0.00 breath alcohol concentration and are released by an SAP (if the prior
incident was alcohol related).

Section 269:
2. Follow-up testing. An employee requiring return to duty drug/alcohol testing shall be
subject to unannounced drug/alcohol tests for up to 24 months after returning to work. Return to
duty drug tests shall be limited to testing for cocaine, marijuana, opiates, amphetamines,
phencyclidine, benzodiazepines, methaqualone, meperidine (Demerol), and barbiturates. There
may be no fewer than six tests in the first twelve months of follow-up testing. The specific number
will be recommended by the SAP. The cost of return to duty testing and the six follow-up tests
shall be paid by the employee.

Section 270:
3. Canceled Test. When a return to duty drug test is determined to be a canceled test by
the MRO, the employee shall immediately submit another urine specimen for testing.
E. Random Testing

Section 271:
1. Application. All House employees performing safety-sensitive functions shall be
subject to random unannounced drug and alcohol tests at the rate designated in Section 109 (E)
(2). Random drug testing shall be limited to testing for cocaine, marijuana, opiates, amphetamines,
and phencyclidine.

Section 272:
2. Method of Section and Selection Rate. The selection of employees for random testing
shall be made by a scientifically valid method, such as a random number table or a computer based
13
Adopted: 1/13/2025
RULES OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TWENTY-FOURTH LEGISLATURE
random number generator that is matched with employees' Social Security number, payroll
identification numbers, or other comparable identifying numbers. Under the selection process
used, each covered employee shall have an equal chance of being tested each time selections are
made. The selection rate for each calendar year will be no less than an annualized rate of 50% of
the covered employees for urine drug testing and 25% for breath alcohol testing.

Section 273:
3. Notification of Employee. When notified of a random selection, employees shall
immediately proceed to the collection site. All testing shall be performed on paid time. Failure of
the employee to timely report to the collection site will be treated as a refusal to be tested.

Section 274:
SECTION 110. SPECIMEN COLLECTION
A. Specimen Collection Sites
Urine and breath specimens shall only be collected at sites approved by the Speaker.
B. Specimen Collection Persons
Only persons trained in the SAMHSA collection process are authorized to collect

approved training program are authorized to collect breath specimens.
C. Specimen Collection Protocol
Breath and urine specimens shall be collected in accordance with established
collection protocols and shall adhere to the collection requirements specified in 49 CFR
Part 40, "Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs."
D. Split Urine Specimens
All urine collections will be split into two specimens and shipped to the laboratory.
If the drug test result of the primary urine specimen is confirmed positive, the employee
may request that the MRO direct the split specimen to be tested in a different DHHS-
certified laboratory for presence of the drug(s) for which a positive result was obtained in
the test of the primary specimen. The request must be in writing to the MRO and must be
made within 72 hours of the employee having been notified of the confirmed positive drug
test result. The cost of the second test shall be paid by the person requesting the test.

Section 275:

(c) Whenever a quorum fails to vote on a question and the vote is objected to for that cause
and a point of order that a quorum is not present is sustained, there shall be a Call of the House,
unless the House adjourns, and members responding to the call shall record their presence by
voting "Yes" or "No" on the question: Provided, that any member arrested shall be brought before
the House, noted as present, discharged from arrest, and given an opportunity to record his/her

voting, and further proceedings under the call shall be considered as dispensed with.
(d) It shall not be in order to make or entertain a point of order suggesting the absence of a
quorum before or during the prayer, during the administration of the oath, during the reading of

and a re-entry contract is executed.
B. Reasonable Suspicion Testing
All employees shall be subject to drug/alcohol testing if there is reasonable suspicion to
believe he or she may be under the influence of illegal drugs or alcohol. Reasonable suspicion drug
testing shall be limited to testing for cocaine, marijuana, opiates, amphetamines, phencyclidine,
benzodiazepines, methaqualone, meperidine (Demerol), and barbiturates.
1. Reasonable Suspicion Defined. Reasonable suspicion for drug/alcohol testing means
specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations concerning the appearance, behavior, speech,
or body odors of the individual. A reasonable suspicion decision must be based on specific facts,
circumstances, physical evidence, physical signs and symptoms, or a pattern of performance and/or
behavior that would cause a trained supervisor to reasonably conclude that the individual may have
engaged in on the job illegal drug or alcohol use or may be under the influence of alcohol or illegal
drugs.

Adopted: 1/13/2025

RULES OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TWENTY-FOURTH LEGISLATURE
2. Steps in Reasonable Suspicion Testing
a. Objective Inquiry. When reasonable suspicion exists, the affected individual will be
questioned and observed. A decision to request a specimen shall be based on eye witness reports,
facts of the event, and observed physical and behavioral characteristics of the individual. The
individual shall be interviewed in a private area.
b. Verification. No individual shall be required to submit to a reasonable suspicion
drug/alcohol test unless the need for the test is verified by a second House of Representatives
supervisor who has received training in recognition of signs and symptoms of drug and alcohol
abuse. The required verification shall be done in person.
c. Duty Pending Test Results. Until the results of the drug/alcohol test are complete and
verified, no employee tested based upon reasonable suspicion shall be allowed to perform or
continue to perform a safety-sensitive function.
d. Transportation Assistance. The individual shall be accompanied to the collection site by
a supervisor or manager, and shall be provided transportation home from the collection site. If the
individual refuses and demands to drive his/her vehicle, the supervisor or manager shall notify the
Department of Public Safety.
e. Report. The events leading to a reasonable suspicion test will be reduced to writing and
will be reviewed by the Speaker or his or her designee. This report shall be considered confidential
and will be maintained in a separate confidential file until utilized in disciplinary action, in which
case it will be filed in the employee's Official Personnel Folder.
C. Post-Accident/Incident Testing
All employees shall be subject to drug/alcohol testing if an accident/incident occurs that
meets the definitions of Section 102 (A). Post-accident/incident drug testing shall be limited to
testing for cocaine, marijuana, opiates, amphetamines, phencyclidine, benzodiazepines,
methaqualone, meperidine (Demerol), and barbiturates. If an accident/incident causes severe life
disabling injury or may cause substantial liability to House of Representatives, a blood sample
may be drawn for future testing if breath alcohol testing is not readily available.
1. Persons Subject to Post-Accident/Incident Testing.
a. The driver of any House vehicle or operator of any House equipment involved in an
accident/incident shall be tested.
b. Each employee whose action or inaction contributed to the accident/incident or whose
action cannot be completely discounted as a contributing factor to the accident/incident (as
determined by using the best information available at the time of the decision) shall be tested.
12
Adopted: 1/13/2025

RULES OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TWENTY-FOURTH LEGISLATURE
2. Test Specimens. Every effort shall be made to collect specimens as soon as practical
following an accident/incident. However, nothing should prevent an injured person from receiving
necessary medical treatment and/or being interviewed by investigating officers/personnel.
3. Duty Pending Test Results. Until the results of the drug/alcohol test are complete and
verified, no employee tested shall be allowed to perform or continue to perform a safety-sensitive
function; provided, however, that an employee may be allowed to perform or continue to perform
a safety-sensitive function, pending the results, if the supervisor reasonably believes that the
employee was not under the influence at the time of the accident/incident.
4. Delayed Reporting of Accident/Incidents. An employee who delays the reporting of
an accident/incident, which could have resulted in a drug or alcohol test, beyond the scheduled
work shift shall be regarded as refusing to be tested.
D. Return to Duty Testing (Re-entry to Work) and Follow-up Testing
1. Return to Duty Testing Criteria. An employee in a non-safety sensitive position,
having previously tested positive for drugs or alcohol or having voluntarily acknowledged being
under the influence of drugs or alcohol while on duty, other than as specified in Section 104 (C) (3)
and (4) will be required to pass a drug/alcohol test before being returned to duty. These employees
will not be allowed to return to work until they: (1) Test negative for cocaine, marijuana, opiates,
amphetamines, phencyclidine, benzodiazepines, methaqualone, meperidine (Demerol), and
barbiturates, and are evaluated and released for duty by the MRO (if the prior incident was drug
related); or (2) Test at 0.00 breath alcohol concentration and are released by an SAP (if the prior
incident was alcohol related).
2. Follow-up testing. An employee requiring return to duty drug/alcohol testing shall be
subject to unannounced drug/alcohol tests for up to 24 months after returning to work. Return to
duty drug tests shall be limited to testing for cocaine, marijuana, opiates, amphetamines,
phencyclidine, benzodiazepines, methaqualone, meperidine (Demerol), and barbiturates. There
may be no fewer than six tests in the first twelve months of follow-up testing. The specific number
will be recommended by the SAP. The cost of return to duty testing and the six follow-up tests
shall be paid by the employee.
3. Canceled Test. When a return to duty drug test is determined to be a canceled test by
the MRO, the employee shall immediately submit another urine specimen for testing.
E. Random Testing
1. Application. All House employees performing safety-sensitive functions shall be
subject to random unannounced drug and alcohol tests at the rate designated in Section 109 (E)
(2). Random drug testing shall be limited to testing for cocaine, marijuana, opiates, amphetamines,
and phencyclidine.
2. Method of Section and Selection Rate. The selection of employees for random testing
shall be made by a scientifically valid method, such as a random number table or a computer based
13
Adopted: 1/13/2025

RULES OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TWENTY-FOURTH LEGISLATURE
random number generator that is matched with employees' Social Security number, payroll
identification numbers, or other comparable identifying numbers. Under the selection process
used, each covered employee shall have an equal chance of being tested each time selections are
made. The selection rate for each calendar year will be no less than an annualized rate of 50% of
the covered employees for urine drug testing and 25% for breath alcohol testing.
3. Notification of Employee. When notified of a random selection, employees shall
immediately proceed to the collection site. All testing shall be performed on paid time. Failure of
the employee to timely report to the collection site will be treated as a refusal to be tested.
SECTION 110. SPECIMEN COLLECTION
A. Specimen Collection Sites
Urine and breath specimens shall only be collected at sites approved by the Speaker.
B. Specimen Collection Persons
Only persons trained in the SAMHSA collection process are authorized to collect
urine specimens, and only persons trained as Breath Alcohol Technicians in a DOT
approved training program are authorized to collect breath specimens.
C. Specimen Collection Protocol
Breath and urine specimens shall be collected in accordance with established
collection protocols and shall adhere to the collection requirements specified in 49 CFR
Part 40, "Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs."
D. Split Urine Specimens
All urine collections will be split into two specimens and shipped to the laboratory.
If the drug test result of the primary urine specimen is confirmed positive, the employee
may request that the MRO direct the split specimen to be tested in a different DHHS-
certified laboratory for presence of the drug(s) for which a positive result was obtained in
the test of the primary specimen. The request must be in writing to the MRO and must be
made within 72 hours of the employee having been notified of the confirmed positive drug
test result. The cost of the second test shall be paid by the person requesting the test.
SECTION 111. SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES
A. Reasonable Suspicion and Post-Accident/Incident Testing
Supervisors shall base testing requests on objective observations and shall
document all steps taken in requiring reasonable suspicion and post-accident/incident tests.
B. Confidentiality
Supervisors shall communicate information regarding a fit for work incident strictly
on a need to know basis.
14
Adopted: 1/13/2025

reasonable suspicion request. Referrals made as a part of supervisory performance
counseling or intervention shall be kept confidentiality, and only necessary persons
shall be made aware of these requests.
3. An employee testing positive for the presence of alcohol or illegal drugs
and who is not removed from employment as a result shall be referred to a substance
abuse professional for assessment and will be required to fulfill specified steps of
treatment before being considered ready for evaluation for return to duty to any
position at the House of Representatives.
B. Return to Duty Evaluation
No employee shall return to work after a positive test for alcohol or drugs
(confirmed positive by the MRO) until he or she has been evaluated and released for duty
by an SAP.
C. Confidentiality and Conduct
A direct request by the employee for assistance may only be made a part of the
employee's medical file and may not be included in the employee's Official Personnel
Folder. Any related performance issues or disciplinary action, however, may be included
in the employee's Official Personnel Folder.
D. Freedom from Discrimination
Employees may not have job security or promotional opportunities jeopardized
solely because of a request for assistance.
E. Notice of Treatment Resources
Any employee testing positive for prohibited drugs and/or alcohol or found to be
under the influence of alcohol shall be advised of resources available to evaluate and
15
Adopted: 1/13/2025

including the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of substance abuse professionals
and counseling and treatment programs.
F. Re-entry to Work After Mandatory Referral

work until (1) the employee has been released for work by a designated House
representative and the MRO/consulting physician (for drug positives) or House of
Representatives' substance abuse professional (for alcohol positives); and (2) the employee
has tested negative on a return to duty drug/alcohol test.
2. In addition, no employee may return to work after a mandatory referral until the

c. A statement of expected compliance with House of Representatives work
rules, policies, and procedures; and
d. An agreement by the employee that violation of the agreement will be

in a location separate from the employee's Official Personnel Folder. The status of an
employee's drug/alcohol test may only be communicated within the House of
Representatives on a strict need-to-know basis. Test results may not be used in a criminal
prosecution of the employee without the employee's consent.
2. Employee Substance Abuse Professional Referrals. Any knowledge of an
employee's attendance at a substance abuse treatment program shall be treated the same as
medical data and shall be filed in the employee's medical file. The status of an employee's

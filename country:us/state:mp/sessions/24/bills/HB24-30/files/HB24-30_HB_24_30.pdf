BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24TH NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Findings and Purpose. Section 1512 of Title 4 of the
2 Commonwealth Code establishes a special Cannabis Tax Account (CTA) separate
3 and apart from the general fund. Taxes collected pursuant to 4 CMC § 1402(a)(21),
4 4 CMC § 1310, and any other gross revenue taxes imposed under Title 4, Division
5 1, Chapter 3, that are generated from licensees of the Cannabis Commission are
6 deposited into the CTA for appropriation by the Legislature. Of the total
7 appropriation provided under this section, twenty-five percent (25%) is statutorily
8 required to be allocated to the Public School System. Account 1501S is the account
9 established pursuant to 4 CMC § 1512, and as of March 31, 2025, Account 1501S

HOUSE BILL 24- VP
1 has a certified balance of $112,358.38.
2 As previously mentioned, the law requires that twenty-five percent (25%)
3 of the appropriation provided for pursuant to 4 CMC § 1512 be allocated to the
4 Public School System (PSS). As such, the Legislature finds it prudent to segregate
5 the twenty-five percent (25%) designated for PSS under 4 CMC § 1512 into a
6 separate sub-account within the Cannabis Tax Account. This subaccount will be
7 used to reserve PSS's designated share.
8 Section 53036(g) of Title 4 of the Commonwealth Code states that all
9 license fees and application fees established under 4 CMC § 53036(d) shall be
10 placed in an account separate from the general fund to pay the expenses necessary
11 for the operation of the CNMI Cannabis Commission, subject to legislative
12 appropriation. The Chairman of the Commission, or his or her designee, shall serve
13 as the expenditure authority of this account. Account 1501B is the account
14 established pursuant to 4 CMC § 53036(g), and as of March 31, 2025, Account
15 1501B has a certified balance of $372,442.50.
16 Thus, the purpose of this Act is to appropriate funds from Accounts 1501B
17 and 1501S to support the operational and personnel needs of the CNMI Cannabis
18 Commission and to direct the Secretary of Finance to establish and maintain a
19 separate sub-account within the Cannabis Tax Account for the purpose of
20 segregating and reserving PSS's designated share.

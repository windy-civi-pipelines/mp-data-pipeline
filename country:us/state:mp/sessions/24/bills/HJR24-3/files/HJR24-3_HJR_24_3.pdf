TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Session, 2025 H. J. R. 24-3
A HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION
To urge the United States Congress to require all contractors and
subcontractors performing federally funded work in the
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands to register with the
CNMI Department of Finance and certify compliance with CNMI
tax laws as a condition of receiving federal payments, to request the
U.S. Department of Defense to adopt a CNMI-specific clause in the
Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to
institutionalize this requirement, and to affirm the CNMI' s right
under Section 703(b) of the Covenant to receive federal income tax
revenues generated from contract work performed in the
Commonwealth.
WHEREAS, allocation of federal income taxes derived from the Northern
Mariana Islands is governed by Section 703(b) of the Covenant, which mandates
that such taxes be returned to the treasury of the CNMI Government. These taxes
are not federal transfers, but collections from private companies operating within
CNMI borders; and
WHEREAS, contractors performing federally funded work in the
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands currently do not register with the
CNMI Department of Finance or comply with CNMI tax obligations, despite
generating taxable income through physical labor, technical services, or contract
oversight within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth; and

HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 24-471
WHEREAS, structural enforcement gaps—specifically the absence of
federal procurement requirements that ensure tax registration and certification—
have led to persistent tax leakage, depriving the CNMI of revenue necessary for
fiscal self-sufficiency and placing compliant local contractors at a competitive
disadvantage; and
WHEREAS, harmonization of federal acquisition protocols with CNMI
revenue law is necessary to close these gaps. The Legislature therefore urges the
United States Congress to require, as a condition of federal payment, that all
contractors and subcontractors performing federally funded work in the CNMI
register with the CNMI Department of Finance and certify compliance with local
tax laws, and to request that the U.S. Department of Defense adopt a CNMI-specific
clause in the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to
enforce this obligation; and
WHEREAS, bolstering regional calls for stricter territorial tax
enforcement, Vice Speaker Tony Ada of the Guam Legislature has requested that
Congress incorporate a Guam-specific DFARS clause in the FY 2026 National
Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), requiring contractor registration and tax
compliance with Guam law, citing audit findings of underreporting and potential
losses exceeding $200 million in business privilege taxes. His request reflects a
growing consensus that federal procurement rules must be updated to ensure
territorial tax compliance. The CNMI Legislature affirms this approach and urges

HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 24-
that identical registration and certification protocols be required of all contractors
and subcontractors performing federally funded work in the CNMI; and
WHEREAS, affirming the Guam legislator's sentiment, CNMI Delegate
to the United States Congress, the Honorable Kimberlyn King-Hinds, in a letter
dated July 10, 2025 to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, also
called attention to a serious gap in the enforcement of Section 703(b) of the
Covenant, noting that despite over $153 million in Department of Defense
construction spending on Tinian, the CNMI collected only $87,000 in tax revenue;
and
WHEREAS, continuing failure to enforce CNMI-specific tax compliance
requirements has allowed federally funded contractors to operate within the
Commonwealth without registering with the Department of Finance or paying
applicable taxes—resulting in structural revenue loss and undeimining the CNMI's
ability to sustain critical public services and invest in long-term infrastructure; and
WHEREAS, knowledge of the Covenant and its fiscal terms is essential to
understanding that the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands was
established through a negotiated deal—approved by both sides, ratified by
plebiscite, and enacted by Congress as federal law. That solemn and mutually
binding deal is the Covenant—a mutual agreement meant to allow the CNMI to
govern itself, generate its own revenue, and avoid dependence on federal handouts.
Section 703(b) of the Covenant is part of that deal. It requires that federal income

HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 24- 3
taxes derived from work performed in the CNMI be returned to the CNMI
Treasury. These taxes are not federal gifts—they are payments made by private
contractors for work done in the CNMI. Keeping those revenues in Washington
violates the terms of the deal. If the Covenant is to mean anything, its terms must
be respected. Honor the agreement. Enforce the law.
1 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the House of
2 Representatives of the Twenty-Fourth Northern Marianas Commonwealth
3 Legislature, the Senate concurring, that the Legislature respectfully urges the
4 United States Congress to include in the FY 2026 National Defense Authorization
5 Act a requirement that all contractors and subcontractors performing federally
6 funded work in the CNMI register with the CNMI Department of Finance and
7 certify compliance with CNMI tax laws as a condition of receiving federal
8 payments;
9 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature requests the United
10 States Department of Defense to adopt a CNMI-specific clause in the Defense
11 Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), requiring registration with
12 the CNMI Department of Finance and certification of tax compliance by all
13 contractors and subcontractors receiving federal funds for work performed in the
14 CNMI;
15 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature requests that such
16 registration and tax certification be documented and submitted as a condition for

1 receiving progress or final payments under applicable federal contracts and
2 subcontracts for work conducted in the CNMI;
3 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature expresses its full
4 support for Delegate King-Hinds' July 10, 2025 letter to the U.S. Department of
5 the Treasury and affirms that failure to remit federal taxes derived from the CNMI
6 constitutes a material breach of Section 703(b) of the Covenant;
7 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that if, within a reasonable time following
8 formal notice, the United States government fails to honor its obligations under
9 Section 703(b) of the Covenant by remitting federal income taxes derived from
10 CNMI-based contract work, the CNMI Legislature will demand enforcement of the
11 Covenant and will call upon the Secretary of Finance and the Governor of the
12 Commonwealth to initiate all lawful remedies available to uphold the terms of the
13 agreement;
14 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that this resolution shall constitute formal
15 and official notice by the House of Representatives and Senate of the
16 Commonwealth Legislature, acting on behalf of the government of the
17 Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, that full compliance with Section
18 703(b) is expected, and that noncompliance will trigger all lawful legal and political
19 remedies available to the Commonwealth;
20 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that certified copies of this resolution be
21 transmitted to the Honorable Kimberlyn King-Hinds, CNMI Delegate to the U.S.

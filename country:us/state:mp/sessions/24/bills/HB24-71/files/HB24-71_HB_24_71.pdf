COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Findings and Purpose. The Legislature finds that the Substance
2 Abuse, Addiction & Rehabilitation (SAAR) Program was established by Executive
3 Order No. 2018-07 as a program under the Office of the Governor. Their mission
4 is to change the lives of individuals struggling with Substance Use Disorder (SUD)
5 & addiction. Furthermore, their purpose is to provide an opportunity for members
6 of the community to access and avail of drug and alcohol treatment and
7 rehabilitation services. Despite such a noble mission and purpose, the funding of
8 the SAAR Program is heavily reliant on annual budget appropriations every fiscal
9 year. Cognizant of the costs associated with running the program's day-to-day
10 operations and personnel, the Legislature finds that it would be highly appropriate
11 to enable the SAAR Program to promulgate fees that they deem necessary to run
12 their operations. In granting such authority, the SAAR Program will become more

TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
AI f ueotlw aP-r
S.6eayt-..1 Regular Session, 2025 H. B. 24-
To provide a nonrefundable tax credit to taxpayers who make
donations of cash or food supplies to qualified community-based
service organizations.

BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24T NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Findings and Purpose. The Legislature finds that business
2 closures and job disruptions caused by COVID-19 have created an urgent need for
3 the services of food pantries, homeless shelters, and soup kitchens in the CNMI.
4 Given the current economic crisis and high rate of unemployment, there is no other
5 governmental policy that deserves a higher priority.
6 Toward this end, this Act encourages taxpayers to make charitable
7 donations to local organizations that provide community-based services, such as
8 food distribution, shelter, and prepared meals, to low-income individuals, people
9 without housing, and other vulnerable populations within the CNMI. Further, the
10 Legislature finds that by establishing a nonrefundable tax credit for donations of
11 cash and food supplies to qualified community-based service organizations, this
12 Act incentivizes contributions that directly address food insecurity and
HOUSE BILL 24-1 3
1 homelessness. Additionally, in support of responsible government fiscal policy, the
2 nonrefundable tax credit established herein is capped, taxpayers are prevented from
3 receiving double benefits by claiming both deductions under the Northern Marianas
4 Territorial Income Tax and the tax credit established by this Act, and
5 documentation requirements must be met in order to claim the credit.
6 Thus, based on the foregoing, this Act provides a nonrefundable tax credit
7 to taxpayers who make donations of cash or food supplies to qualified community-
8 based service organizations.
9 Section 2. Amendment. Title 4, Division 1, Chapter 2, of the
10 Commonwealth Code is hereby amended by adding a new Section 1208 to read as
11 follows:
12 "§ 1208. Food Pantry Nonrefundable Tax Credit.
13 (a) Any taxpayer that makes a donation of cash or food supplies to
14 a Qualified Community-Based Service Organization, such as a
15 local food pantry, homeless shelter, or soup kitchen, may receive
16 a nonrefundable tax credit against the tax imposed by 4 CMC
17 §§ 1201-02 to the extent provided by this Section. No such
18 credit shall be allowed for any amount deducted in determining
19 taxable income under the NMTIT as shown on the taxpayer's
20 return. The "tax imposed on wages and salaries or earnings" for
21 purposes of computing the credit under 4 CMC § 1206 is the tax

HOUSE BILL 24-
1 net of any credit taken pursuant to this Section. Any tax credit
2 not used shall not be applied to future tax years.
3 (b) The maximum credit available in any one year under this Section
4 and 4 CMC § 1312 combined shall be the lesser of the sum of
5 the taxes imposed under 4 CMC §§ 1201-02 and 4 CMC
6 §§ 1301-04, or two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500).
7 (c) A "Qualified Community-Based Service Organization" under
8 this Section means an organization located in the CNMI that has
9 been issued a Letter of Determination granting tax-exempt status
10 under Section 501(c)(3) of the IRC by the Division of Revenue
11 and Taxation prior to the date of the donation for which the tax
12 credit is taken. The organization must also, in the area the
13 taxpayer claiming the tax credit resides, engage in one of the
14 following:
15 (1) The distribution of food supplies to low-income people;
16 (2) The provision of temporary living arrangements for
17 individuals and families who lack fixed, regular, and
18 adequate nighttime residence, or who are otherwise unable
19 to obtain permanent housing; or
20 (3) The provision of prepared meals through an established
21 congregate feeding operation to needy, low-income

1 persons, including, but not limited to, people without

3 (d) "Food supplies" means consumable goods that are fit for human
4 consumption, excluding any goods that have passed their
5 expiration or sell-by date, are damaged or otherwise unsafe for
6 consumption, or that are not in their original sealed packaging.
7 Acceptable food supplies include perishable and non-perishable
8 items such as canned goods, fresh produce, dairy products, and
9 packaged or frozen foods.
10 (e) To obtain the credit, the taxpayer must furnish the following to
11 the Division of Revenue and Taxation:
12 (1) A properly documented receipt issued by the recipient
13 Qualified Community-Based Service Organization that
14 must include, at a minimum, the name and tax identification
15 number of the organization, the taxpayer's name and tax
16 identification number, the date of donation and the amount
17 donated or, for donations of food supplies, a reasonable fair
18 market value assessment of the food supplies, and the

8 §§ 1301-04 to the extent provided by this Section. No such
9 credit shall be allowed for any amount deducted in determining
10 taxable income under the NMTIT as shown on the taxpayer's
11 return. For the purpose of computing the nonrefundable tax

14 shall not be applied to future tax years.

17 which shall already be in existence on the date this Act becomes effective.

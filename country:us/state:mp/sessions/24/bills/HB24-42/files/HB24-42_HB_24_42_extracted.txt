Section 1:
TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
21f.-42
Regular Session, 2025 H. B.
To mandate comprehensive, standards-based financial literacy
education in all public high schools and middle schools of the
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI); to
establish curriculum standards, teacher training support,
integration with workforce development programs, and
implementation timelines; and for other purposes.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24TH NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Short Title. This Act may be cited as the "CNMI Financial
2 Literacy Education Act of 2025."
3 Section 2. Findings and Purpose. Financial literacy is an essential life
4 skill that reduces poverty, strengthens household resilience, and contributes to the
5 economic development of the Commonwealth. However, a majority of graduating
6 students receive little to no formal instruction in core financial competencies such
7 as budgeting, credit management, saving, investing, taxation, risk management,
8 consumer protection, and entrepreneurship.
9 Across the United States, more than half of all states now require personal
10 finance instruction as a condition for high school graduation—establishing a clear
24-412
HOUSE BILL
1 national best practice. This trend reflects growing recognition that early financial
2 education is foundational to individual and community well-being.
3 In the CNMI, the need is especially urgent. Local households face high
4 living costs, limited retirement preparation, and increased vulnerability to predatory
5 lending. Despite these challenges, the public school system currently lacks a
6 uniformly mandated, standards-based program dedicated to financial literacy.
7 Integrating financial literacy into the CNMI curriculum—aligned with
8 Workforce Investment and Opportunity Act (WIOA) youth services, Department
9 of Labor apprenticeship initiatives, and economic diversification strategies—will
10 expand job readiness and entrepreneurial capacity among young people. Therefore,
11 the purpose of this Act is to mandate and support age-appropriate financial literacy
12 instruction for all students in grades 6-12; to ensure qualified teacher training; to
13 integrate instruction with workforce development pathways; and to implement
14 program evaluation mechanisms that improve long-term outcomes.
15 Section 3. Enactment. Subject to codification by the Commonwealth Law
16 Revision Commission, the following is hereby enacted into law:

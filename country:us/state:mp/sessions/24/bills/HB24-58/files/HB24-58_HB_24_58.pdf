TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
I 029, r
Session, 2025 H. B. 24- S
A BILL FOR AN ACT
To amend 4 CMC § 1305 to exempt services and the sale or
exchange of securities and other similar assets from gross
revenue tax; to amend 4 CMC § 1708 to allow rebates for
exempted activities; to repeal 4 CMC § 1712; and for other
purposes.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24TH NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Findings and Purpose. The Legislature finds that the current
2 CNMI tax code presents impediments to attracting and retaining individuals and
3 businesses operating in the global digital economy and global financial markets.
4 Minor changes to the Business Gross Revenue Tax (BGRT) exemptions can help
5 remove these barriers and foster the growth of such industries in the
6 Commonwealth, potentially resulting in significant increases in overall tax
7 revenues.
8 Manufacturers and producers of physical goods that are produced in the
9 CNMI and exported outside the Commonwealth are currently exempt from the
10 BGRT. In contrast, a large and growing share of modern businesses—particularly
11 those in the digital economy—do not sell physical goods, but instead offer services

1 such as remote education, customer service, consulting, human resources support,
2 and memberships or subscriptions to online platforms. A CNMI-based business
3 exporting services provides comparable economic value to the CNMI as one
4 exporting physical goods. Accordingly, extending the BGRT exemption to
5 qualified export service businesses will increase the CNMI's attractiveness as a
6 domicile and tax residence for individuals and entities engaged in the global digital
7 economy.
8 The Legislature further finds that the current structure of the BGRT renders
9 it economically unattractive for financial businesses to establish operations in the
10 CNMI. Many of these firms generate revenue through the trading of securities or
11 other capital assets, which produce capital gains or losses and are ultimately taxed
12 under the Northern Marianas Territorial Income Tax (NMTIT). However, under the
13 current BGRT structure, the gross revenues from such trades are subject to
14 taxation—even if the trades result in a net loss. As a result, the effective tax burden
15 on such firms is prohibitively high, discouraging them from domiciling in the
16 CNMI. Exempting the sale or exchange of securities and similar financial assets
17 from the BGRT would allow the CNMI to compete for participation in global
18 financial markets, thereby unlocking an entirely new stream of tax revenue through
19 income taxation under the NMTIT.
20 For reference, the U.S. securities brokerage market is projected to grow
21 from $196.99 billion in 2024 to $242.33 billion by 2029, at a compound annual

HOUSE BILL 24-
1 growth rate of 4.23%. Capturing even a fraction of this market could yield
2 substantial tax revenue for the CNMI. Additional economic benefits would include
3 increased revenues from income, wage and salary, and earnings taxes paid by
4 employees and owners of firms domiciled in the Commonwealth.
5 The Legislature also finds that 4 CMC § 1712 , enacted by Public Law 5-
6 40 in 1987, imposes sourcing rules on former residents of the United States and
7 other U.S. territories that are inconsistent with the Internal Revenue Code (IRC),
8 which the CNMI adopted in mirror form as the NMTIT, as required by the
9 Covenant. Section 1712 predates the promulgation of Treasury Regulation § 1.937-
10 2 and deviates significantly from the sourcing rules in IRC § 865 and applicable
11 Treasury guidance. These federal provisions govern the sourcing of gains from the
12 sale of property by individuals who change residence to a U.S. territory and reflect
13 the current interpretation of applicable federal law. Because the CNMI is required
14 under the Covenant to maintain an income tax system that mirrors the IRC, the
15 substantive deviations created by § 1712 likely violate that mandate.
16 In addition to raising legal concerns, Section 1712 may serve as a deterrent
17 to relocation and investment by U.S.-based individuals and businesses, as it
18 imposes more burdensome tax consequences than those faced under federal law.
19 Repealing Section 1712 would restore consistency with the mirror code and
20 applicable federal sourcing rules, allowing qualifying capital gains to be treated as
21 CNMI-source income.

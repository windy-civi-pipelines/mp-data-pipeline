Section 1:
TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Regular Session, 2025 H. B. 24- &&
To regulate advisory and consulting engagements with the Commonwealth by
requiring compliance with procurement laws, Attorney General approval, and
Public Auditor oversight; to impose a $50,000.00 cap per engagement; to establish
priority qualifications; to void non-compliant contracts; to provide remedies and
penalties for violations; and to sunset this Act after five years.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24TH NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Short Title: This Act shall be known and may be cited as the
2 "Public Procurement Integrity and Advisor Accountability Act of 2025".
3 Section 2. Findings and Purpose: Procurement law in the Commonwealth
4 requires that all public contracts comply with uniform procedures, and no
5 agreement is valid unless it conforms to those statutory and regulatory standards.
6 The Attorney General is specifically charged with reviewing and approving all
7 contracts as to form and legality, and the Office of the Public Auditor has
8 constitutional and statutory authority to audit procurement compliance and the
9 disbursement of public funds.
10 Accountability is compromised when infounal engagements, oral
11 agreements, or uncompensated advisory arrangements occur within executive
HOUSE BILL 24- &
1 branch agencies, departments, boards, or commissions. Such practices risk
2 violating procurement law, undermine transparency, expose the Commonwealth to
3 fiscal and legal liability, and interfere with oversight. To prevent these dangers, the
4 Legislature establishes a maximum contract value of fifty thousand dollars
5 ($50,000.00) for any advisory engagement, a limit comparable to rates in other
6 similarly situated jurisdictions and one that ensures fiscal responsibility. Priority is
7 also given to economists and CNMI scholars with a master's degree in political
8 science to foster local talent, attract skilled advisors, and support the rebuilding of
9 the Commonwealth during this period of economic recovery.
10 Constitutional principles require that no contract may bind the
11 Commonwealth without proper expenditure authority under Articles II and III of
12 the Constitution. This Act reinforces that mandate by prohibiting executive branch
13 agencies, departments, boards, and commissions from authorizing salaries or
14 payments in excess of the statutory fifty thousand dollar ($50,000.00) limit, thereby
15 preserving separation of powers and legislative control over appropriations.
16 Transparency is strengthened by requiring agencies to maintain public
17 registers of advisory engagements and submit quarterly reports subject to audit by
18 the Office of the Public Auditor. The Act also provides civil and criminal penalties
19 consistent with statutory procedures in Title 4 of the Commonwealth Code, and it
20 includes a five-year sunset provision to ensure future legislative review. Together,
21 these safeguards limit financial and contractual authority to lawful bounds,

HOUSE BILL 24- 470
1 guarantee the validity of public contracts, preserve oversight, and encourage skilled
2 local professionals to contribute to the advancement of the Commonwealth.

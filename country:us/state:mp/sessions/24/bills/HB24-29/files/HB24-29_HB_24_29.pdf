TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Session, 2025 H. B. 24- 2,1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
To reconcile public utility accounts between CHCC and CUC
by waiving intra-governmental penalties and preserving
enforceable debt obligations; and for other purposes.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24TH NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Findings and Purpose. At the time of its creation under Public
2 Law 16-51, the Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation (CHCC) assumed the
3 responsibilities of the former Department of Public Health. CHCC was treated as a
4 government agency and charged the government rate—subjecting it to higher
5 charges than those assessed to similarly situated private healthcare providers. This
6 classification led millions of dollars in unpaid utility charges and penalties. The
7 resulting liability has impaired CHCC's operating budget and constrained its ability
8 to provide uninterrupted public health services.
9 Liabilities resulting from the government rate have imposed financial
10 pressure on CHCC's limited fiscal capacity. As of April 25, 2025, CHCC lists
11 approximately $65 million in outstanding obligations; CUC reports more than $69
12 million in receivables. There is a $4.9 million discrepancy—primarily due to the
13 accumulation of penalties, surcharges, and late fees.

HOUSE BILL 24- Zi
1 Distinctions must therefore be made between enforceable utility debts-
2 based on actual electricity consumed—and intra-governmental penalties, which
3 serve no constructive fiscal purpose. Charges imposed by one public agency upon
4 another do not generate revenue for the government as a whole. Instead, they
5 artificially overstate account balances, complicate audits and financial reporting,
6 and misrepresent the real obligations between departments. Left unaddressed, they
7 obscure institutional performance and obstruct responsible budgeting. In addition,
8 the mere inability to agree on the amount owed has strained their respective
9 operating budgets and distorted the financial posture of both agencies.
10 Acknowledging the need for financial clarity and institutional stability, the
11 Legislature finds that waiving these non-principal charges—specifically penalties,
12 surcharges, and late fees—allows both CHCC and CUC to move forward on
13 stronger financial footing. CHCC gains budgetary clarity and the ability to redirect
14 limited funds toward patient services such as off-island medical referrals,
15 preventive care, and other health priorities. CUC, meanwhile, benefits by removing
16 unrecoverable receivables from its books, stabilizing its accounts, and refocusing
17 on critical infrastructure improvements and capital needs.
18 No portion of CHCC's principal debt is forgiven under this Act. The waiver
19 applies only to administrative penalties and is consistent with the corrective
20 classification enacted in Public Law 23-30.

Section 1:
TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
H. B. Zit 13
Regular Session, 2025
To create a new criminal offense for Desecration or Theft of
Memorials and Historical Sites.
11
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24T NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Findings and Purpose. Sites of remembrance, reconciliation,
2 and cultural identity—such as public memorials, historic landmarks, and
3 commemorative structures—hold deep meaning for the people of the
4 Commonwealth and for visitors who share in our history. These places are not only
5 local heritage sites; they are enduring symbols of peace, sacrifice, and international
6 goodwill. The recent theft and vandalism of the Korean Peace Memorial bust of
7 Mr. Yong Taek Lee—a revered representation of friendship between the CNMI and
8 the Republic of Korea—and other similar acts at historical or tourist sites are not
9 merely property crimes. They are acts of desecration that diminish the Marianas'
10 standing as a safe and respectful place—one that honors the sacrifices made here
11 and the relationships those sites were built to represent.
HOUSE BILL Z g 6413
1 In its current form, the CNMI' s general vandalism statute-6 CMC
2 § 1805—fails to capture the distinct and compounded harm caused when memorials
3 or culturally significant sites are defiled. While the statute criminalizes property
4 damage, it draws no distinction between routine vandalism—such as graffiti or
5 minor destruction—and the desecration of structures that carry ceremonial,
6 symbolic, or international importance. This lack of legal recognition leaves
7 prosecutors and courts without the tools to reflect the full gravity of such acts. As
8 a result, the Commonwealth's ability to deter these offenses and respond
9 meaningfully remains limited.
10 The lack of a specific legal remedy—one that goes beyond merely
11 prosecuting property damage—weakens deterrence and leaves culturally
12 significant sites vulnerable to repeat offenses. When such acts go unpunished or are
13 treated as routine vandalism, the message conveyed is one of indifference. Without
14 a legal distinction that captures the true nature of these violations, we cannot fully
15 confront or correct the harm they cause.
16 Enactment of this "full force" legislation empowers the Commonwealth to
17 respond decisively to acts that target the sites most sacred to our shared identity.
18 By establishing a distinct criminal offense, imposing enhanced penalties, and
19 requiring full restitution, this Act ensures that such violations are no longer treated
20 as minor offenses. The Legislature affirms that memorials and historical sites
21 deserve not only preservation, but protection rooted in principle—protection that

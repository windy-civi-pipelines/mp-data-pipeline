Section 1:
TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
52,
Regular Session, 2025 H. B. 24-
To establish a tax on transient accommodations and to regulate the
operation of short-term rentals in the Commonwealth; and for other
purposes.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24TH NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Findings and Purpose. The proliferation of short-term rentals
2 involving nontraditional accommodations—such as houses, apartments, and
3 condominium units—has significantly altered the landscape of the
4 Commonwealth's housing market. These rentals, often marketed to tourists and
5 transient occupants, have led to increased competition for housing, rising long-term
6 rental prices, and regulatory challenges in residentially zoned areas. Operators who
7 fail to comply with business licensing, zoning rules, and tax laws undermine the
8 integrity of the market and place law-abiding operators at a disadvantage.
9 Registration of all operators engaged in furnishing transient
10 accommodations is essential for effective regulation and tax enforcement. In a
11 sector where listings may involve a single room or an entire resort posted online
12 without direct oversight, the government faces serious challenges in identifying
HOUSE BILL 24- $2•
1 operators and ensuring compliance. A centralized registry will improve
2 enforcement, promote transparency, and ensure a level playing field.
3 Authorizing certain private entities to serve as tax collection agents will ease
4 the burden of administration and improve tax compliance. In particular, online
5 hosting platforms that facilitate booking and payment services are in a strong
6 position to collect and remit taxes on behalf of their operators. Requiring
7 registration of such platforms as tax collection agents will streamline compliance
8 and level the playing field.
9 Noncompliance often stems from operators structuring rental contracts to
10 appear as long-term leases exceeding ninety days while in reality allowing
11 occupancy by individuals for shorter durations. The Legislature finds that an
12 accommodation is subject to tax under this Act if it is used or occupied for fewer
13 than ninety consecutive days, regardless of the stated term of the lease or
14 agreement. The factual use of the accommodation shall govern whether it is deemed
15 transient for taxation purposes.
16 Strengthening enforcement through fines, citations, registration mandates,
17 and platform-level accountability will modernize the Commonwealth's tax
18 framework and prevent further erosion of the tax base. This Act replaces the
19 outdated Hotel Occupancy Tax with a Transient Accommodations Tax that reflects
20 the realities of today's rental and tourism market. Therefore, the purpose of this
21 Act is to:
2
HOUSE BILL 24- S IX
1 1. Repeal the Hotel Occupancy Tax and establish a Transient
2 Accommodations Tax;
3 2. Require persons to register prior to engaging or continuing in the business
4 of furnishing transient accommodations, which includes posting any
5 advertisement for furnishing a transient accommodation;
6 3. Make any person who fails to register prior to engaging or continuing in the
7 business of furnishing transient accommodations, which includes posting
8 any advertisement for furnishing a transient accommodation, subject to a
9 citation process and monetary fines;
10 4. Make any person who enters into an agreement to furnish transient
11 accommodations without registering subject to a citation process and
12 monetary fines;
13 5. Require a hosting platform that collects fees for booking services to register
14 as a tax collection agent on behalf of its operators for purposes of the
15 transient accommodations tax; and
16 6. Make any person who offers transient accommodations through a hosting
17 platform that is not registered as a tax collection agent subject to a citation
18 process and monetary fines.
19 7. Ensure that the revenues collected pursuant to the tax formerly known as
20 the Hotel Occupancy Tax, codified at Title 4 section 1502 as repealed and
21 re-enacted herein, shall continue to be distributed pursuant to Public Law

12 fewer than ninety (90) consecutive days. The Division shall assess the tax
13 on the basis of actual occupancy rather than the duration or form of the
14 agreement under which the accommodation is furnished.
15 (c) Except as otherwise provided, this chapter shall apply to a transient
16 accommodations broker, travel agency, or tour packager who enters into an
17 agreement to furnish transient accommodations at noncommissioned negotiated

TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
52,
Regular Session, 2025 H. B. 24-
A BILL FOR AN ACT
To establish a tax on transient accommodations and to regulate the
operation of short-term rentals in the Commonwealth; and for other
purposes.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24TH NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Findings and Purpose. The proliferation of short-term rentals
2 involving nontraditional accommodations—such as houses, apartments, and
3 condominium units—has significantly altered the landscape of the
4 Commonwealth's housing market. These rentals, often marketed to tourists and
5 transient occupants, have led to increased competition for housing, rising long-term
6 rental prices, and regulatory challenges in residentially zoned areas. Operators who
7 fail to comply with business licensing, zoning rules, and tax laws undermine the
8 integrity of the market and place law-abiding operators at a disadvantage.
9 Registration of all operators engaged in furnishing transient
10 accommodations is essential for effective regulation and tax enforcement. In a
11 sector where listings may involve a single room or an entire resort posted online
12 without direct oversight, the government faces serious challenges in identifying

HOUSE BILL 24- $2•
1 operators and ensuring compliance. A centralized registry will improve
2 enforcement, promote transparency, and ensure a level playing field.
3 Authorizing certain private entities to serve as tax collection agents will ease
4 the burden of administration and improve tax compliance. In particular, online
5 hosting platforms that facilitate booking and payment services are in a strong
6 position to collect and remit taxes on behalf of their operators. Requiring
7 registration of such platforms as tax collection agents will streamline compliance
8 and level the playing field.
9 Noncompliance often stems from operators structuring rental contracts to
10 appear as long-term leases exceeding ninety days while in reality allowing
11 occupancy by individuals for shorter durations. The Legislature finds that an
12 accommodation is subject to tax under this Act if it is used or occupied for fewer
13 than ninety consecutive days, regardless of the stated term of the lease or
14 agreement. The factual use of the accommodation shall govern whether it is deemed
15 transient for taxation purposes.
16 Strengthening enforcement through fines, citations, registration mandates,
17 and platform-level accountability will modernize the Commonwealth's tax
18 framework and prevent further erosion of the tax base. This Act replaces the
19 outdated Hotel Occupancy Tax with a Transient Accommodations Tax that reflects
20 the realities of today's rental and tourism market. Therefore, the purpose of this
21 Act is to:
2

HOUSE BILL 24- S IX
1 1. Repeal the Hotel Occupancy Tax and establish a Transient
2 Accommodations Tax;
3 2. Require persons to register prior to engaging or continuing in the business
4 of furnishing transient accommodations, which includes posting any
5 advertisement for furnishing a transient accommodation;
6 3. Make any person who fails to register prior to engaging or continuing in the
7 business of furnishing transient accommodations, which includes posting
8 any advertisement for furnishing a transient accommodation, subject to a
9 citation process and monetary fines;
10 4. Make any person who enters into an agreement to furnish transient
11 accommodations without registering subject to a citation process and
12 monetary fines;
13 5. Require a hosting platform that collects fees for booking services to register
14 as a tax collection agent on behalf of its operators for purposes of the
15 transient accommodations tax; and
16 6. Make any person who offers transient accommodations through a hosting
17 platform that is not registered as a tax collection agent subject to a citation
18 process and monetary fines.
19 7. Ensure that the revenues collected pursuant to the tax formerly known as
20 the Hotel Occupancy Tax, codified at Title 4 section 1502 as repealed and
21 re-enacted herein, shall continue to be distributed pursuant to Public Law
3

12 fewer than ninety (90) consecutive days. The Division shall assess the tax
13 on the basis of actual occupancy rather than the duration or form of the
14 agreement under which the accommodation is furnished.
15 (c) Except as otherwise provided, this chapter shall apply to a transient
16 accommodations broker, travel agency, or tour packager who enters into an
17 agreement to furnish transient accommodations at noncommissioned negotiated

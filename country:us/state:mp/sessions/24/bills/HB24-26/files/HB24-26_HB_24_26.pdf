Regular Session, 2025 H. B. 24-
A BILL FOR AN ACT
To amend the crime of child abuse.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24TH NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Findings and Purpose: The purpose of the Act is to amend the
2 crime of child abuse to include conduct that places a child in imminent danger
3 through the presence of methamphetamine. The Act specifies that ingesting
4 methamphetamine in the presence of a child or resulting in the presence of
5 methamphetamine in a child is included in the definition of child abuse.
6 The illegal drug methamphetamine is commonly abused in the CNMI.
7 Unfortunately, if ingested in the presence of children, that exposure is dangerous
8 because children can absorb the drug and the person using the drug may harm the
9 child. In addition, pregnant women who use methamphetamine pass the drug on to
10 their child, endangering the health of that child.
11 Many jurisdictions have made endangering a child an offense if the person
12 uses methamphetamine in the presence of a child or if a newly born child tests

13 (ii) any conduct establishing the proximity or accessibility of
14 the controlled substance methamphetamine to the child and an
15 analysis of a specimen of the child's blood, urine, or other bodily
16 substance indicates the presence of methamphetamine in the child's
17 body."

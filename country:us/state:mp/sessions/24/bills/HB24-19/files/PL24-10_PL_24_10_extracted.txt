MAY 15, 2025
H B. No. 24-19
AN ACT
To RENAME THE "CNMI SCHOLARSHIP OFFICE" TO THE
"CNMI SCHOLARSHIP AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
OFFICE."
BE IT ENACTED BY THE TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN
MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
2 The Legislature finds that increasing access to education and workforce training through
3 financial aid opportunities significantly improves the likelihood that local residents will
4 become well-educated, well-equipped contributors to the CNMI' s workforce. Currently, the
5 CNMI Scholarship Office provides such financial aid opportunities through multiple
6 scholarships, such as the Post Secondary Teacher Education Program Scholarship and the
7 Behavioral Health Professional Scholarship.
8 On July 11, 2024, the CNMI Scholarship Board of Directors approved changing the
9 name of the "CNMI Scholarship Office" to the "CNMI Scholarship and Financial Assistance
10 Office" to better reflect the scope of the office's services. These services include, but are not
Public Law No. 24-10
HOUSE BILL 24-19
1 limited to, administering higher education financial assistance programs, which necessarily
2 includes the power to address matters related to delinquent or defaulted financial assistance
3 agreements, and other responsibilities necessary to carry out the office's mission.
4 Based on the foregoing, the Legislature concurs with the CNMI Scholarship Board of
5 Directors' decision to rename the office as it more accurately represents the office's purpose
6 and function. Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to rename the "CNMI Scholarship Office"
7 to the "CNMI Scholarship and Financial Assistance Office."
8 SECTION 2. AMENDMENT.
9 Section 10102 of Chapter 10, Division 1, Title 3 of the Commonwealth Code is hereby
10 amended to read as follows:
11 "§ 10102. CNMI Scholarship and Financial Assistance Office
12 (a) The CNMI Scholarship and Financial Assistance Office is hereby established
13 within the Executive Branch headed by an administrator appointed by the Scholarship
14 Board of Directors.
15 (b) The CNMI Scholarship and Financial Assistance Office is established as an
16 autonomous agency under the general control and direction of the Scholarship Board of
17 Directors. The board shall adopt bylaws that enumerate its purposes, duties, powers, and
18 rules of organization and operation, which bylaws shall not be inconsistent with this
19 article."

2 Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, all references in the Commonwealth
3 Code, regulations, executive orders, or official documents to the "CNMI Scholarship Office"
4 shall be construed to mean the "CNMI Scholarship and Financial Assistance Office."
5 Pursuant to 1 CMC § 3806, the Law Revision Commission shall make all necessary
6 changes to the Commonwealth Code to reflect the renaming of the office, including, but not
7 limited to, correcting cross-references and clerical or typographical errors to ensure
8 conformity and consistency throughout the Code.
9 SECTION 4. SEVERABILITY.

11 circumstance should be held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this
12 Act or the application of its provisions to persons or circumstances other than those to which
13 it is held invalid shall not be affected thereby.

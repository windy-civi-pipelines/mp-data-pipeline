Section 1:
TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
2(1-3')
Session, 2025 H. B.
To suspend the operations of the Commonwealth Casino
Commission; to transfer casino regulatory functions to the
Commonwealth Lottery Commission on an interim basis; to
establish a Division of Gaming within the Department of
Finance; and for other purposes.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24TH NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Findings and Purpose. Public Law 18-56, which established the
2 Commonwealth Casino Commission (CCC), remains in full force and effect
3 because it has not been repealed, amended, or superseded by any valid legislative
4 act. Under the CNMI Constitution, statutory agencies may only be altered by the
5 Legislature. Executive orders cannot nullify an enabling statute or suspend its
6 operation unless such authority is expressly granted by law. Since no such
7 legislative action has occurred, the CCC's legal status, powers, and regulatory
8 obligations continue to exist and must be observed as binding law.
9 Overextension of executive authority risks institutional instability and legal
10 challenge. While the Governor has authority under Article III, Section 15 to
H.B. No.24-317
1 reorganize functions within the executive branch, this power does not extend to the
2 creation or abolition of statutory entities. Executive Order 2025-02 attempts to
3 terminate the CCC's commissioners, transfer its regulatory powers to the Lottery
4 Commission, and redefine its operational framework—actions that exceed
5 constitutional boundaries and encroach on legislative authority.
6 While the policy rationale underlying the Executive Order has merit-
7 namely, the need to address an inactive commission and prevent regulatory
8 paralysis—its execution is flawed. By attempting to restructure or suspend a
9 statutory body through executive directive alone, the order lacks legal foundation
10 and introduces contradictions between agency mandates, personnel qualifications,
11 and lines of authority. Legislative action is the only constitutionally sound
12 mechanism for achieving such reform.
13 Enabling statutes cannot be sidestepped through implied powers. The
14 CNMI Supreme Court has made clear in Torres v. Commonwealth and Sonoda v.
15 Cabrera that the Governor may not rewrite or render ineffective laws duly enacted
16 by the Legislature. Even if the Legislature does not formally disapprove an
17 executive order within the 60-day window, constitutional violations are not cured
18 by inaction. Silent acquiescence does not confer legislative power on the executive
19 branch.
20 Realignment of casino regulatory authority must therefore proceed through
21 statute. This Act provides for an orderly transition from the CCC to a more durable

1 long-term framework by: (1) authorizing the Lottery Commission to serve as the
2 interim regulator; and (2) establishing a Division of Gaming within the Department
3 of Finance. These reforms are grounded in law, preserve agency accountability, and
4 ensure that the Commonwealth's regulatory architecture complies with
5 constitutional requirements.
6 Section 2. Replealer and Suspension of the Commonwealth Casino
7 Commission.
8 Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, all statutory provisions established
9 under Public Law 18-56 and codified at 4 CMC §§ 2301-2309 directly and
10 indirectly relating to the operations, powers, duties, and regulatory authority of the
11 Commonwealth Casino Commission, established under Public Law 18-56 and
12 codified at 4 CMC §§ 2301-2309, are hereby repealed and suspended as of the
13 effective date of this Act and the following provisions shall take immediate effect:
14 A. The Commission shall remain legally constituted but inactive
15 and shall not exercise any regulatory, licensing, investigatory, or
16 enforcement powers unless reactivated by Executive Order
17 issued by the Governor or by a future act of the Legislature. Any
18 Executive Order reactivating the Commission shall be submitted
19 to the Legislature within five calendar days and shall take effect
20 unless modified or disapproved by legislative resolution within
21 sixty days of submission.

TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Regular Session, 2025 H. B. 24- 014
A BILL FOR AN ACT
To establish the CNMI Vehicle Buy-Back and Modernization
Program, enabling the systematic removal and auction of
government vehicles seven years or older, regardless of
operational status, and directing revenues to the CNMI
Modernization Fund to support fleet upgrades across all
agencies.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24TH NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Short Title. This Act shall be known and may be cited as the
2 "CNMI Vehicle Buy-Back and Modernization Act of 2025."
3 Section 2. Findings and Purpose. Facing the reality that a significant
4 number of Commonwealth government vehicles are seven years or older, the
5 Legislature finds that these aging units have become a recurring drain on limited
6 public resources. Their high maintenance costs, frequent breakdowns, and
7 diminished reliability not only weaken operational readiness across agencies but
8 also slow the delivery of essential public services. The accumulation of outdated
9 vehicles demonstrates the need for a systemic solution, rather than piecemeal
10 replacement, to address this persistent burden.

HOUSE BILL 24- (1,14
1 Leveraging a structured buy-back and auction process offers a strategic
2 pathway to convert this liability into an asset. By mandating that aging vehicles be
3 surveyed, decommissioned, and offered to the public through transparent auctions,
4 the Commonwealth can recover value that would otherwise be lost. In turn, this
5 approach expands access to affordable vehicles for residents and businesses, fosters
6 a more active secondary market, and ensures that every stage of the replacement
7 cycle contributes to modernization rather than waste.
8 Ensuring fiscal transparency and legislative oversight is central to this
9 framework. Under Commonwealth law, revenues deposited into any special fund,
10 including the CNMI Modernization Fund created by this Act, cannot be expended
11 absent a legislative appropriation. This constitutional requirement prevents
12 unilateral spending, compels agencies to justify their modernization requests, and
13 enables the Legislature to weigh priorities across departments. By channeling
14 revenues into a non-lapsing fund subject to annual appropriation, the program
15 strengthens both efficiency and accountability while keeping the Legislature firmly
16 in control of resource allocation.
17 Elevating this Fund above the baseline of general revenues is equally
18 important. The Legislature clarifies that proceeds from the Vehicle Buy-Back and
19 Modernization Program are special revenues with a direct and exclusive nexus to
20 government fleet renewal. As such, these funds do not form part of the "general
21 revenues" under Article XV, Section 1(e) of the CNMI Constitution and are not

HOUSE BILL 24- GM
1 subject to the twenty-five percent (25%) computation for the Public School System.
2 By defining this boundary clearly, This Act protects both the PSS's constitutional
3 entitlement and the integrity of a fund designed solely for modernization.
4 Thus, the purpose of This Act is to establish a comprehensive and
5 responsible program for government fleet renewal that turns aged vehicles into an
6 opportunity for progress. By requiring auctions, dedicating proceeds to a special
7 modernization fund, and subjecting expenditures to legislative appropriation, the
8 Commonwealth will achieve long-term savings, improve the safety and efficiency
9 of its vehicle fleet, and reinforce fiscal discipline through transparent oversight.
10 This Act ensures that modernization is not a one-time event but a sustained cycle
11 of accountability and reinvestment.
12 Section 3. Enactment. Title 1, Government, Division 9, Miscellaneous
13 Provisions, of the Commonwealth Code is amended by adding a new Chapter 10 to

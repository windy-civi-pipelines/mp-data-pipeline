TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
SECOND DAY, FIRST REGULAR SESSION
FEBRUARY 14,2025
H. B. No. 24-6, HD1
AN ACT
To AMEND THE APPROPRIATIONS AND BUDGET AUTHORITY
ACT OF FISCAL YEAR 2025, PUBLIC LAW 23-26, TO
APPROPRIATE THE BALANCE OF FUNDS ALLOCATED
FOR THE MINIMUM ANNUAL PAYMENT TO THE
SETTLEMENT FUND AND TO RETURN GOVERNMENT
EMPLOYEES SUBJECT TO AUSTERITY TO 100% WORK
HOURS; AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN
MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.
2 The Legislature finds that the CNMI Government workforce who have
3 dedicated their lives to working for the betterment of the Commonwealth lost
4 wages from the implementation of austerity. Our government employees rely on
5 their fixed incomes that were subject to adjustments due to the impacts of our
6 collapsed economy, exacerbated by natural disasters and the COVID-19 pandemic.
7 The purpose of this Act is to assist the CNMI government workforce in recovering
8 wages necessary to meet the needs of their households which were lost as a result
9 of the reduction in work hours. This bill appropriates the balance of twenty-two

Public Law No. 24-01
HOUSE BILL 24-6, HD1
1 million, forty-two thousand, two hundred seventy-six dollars ($22,042,276) in local
2 funds from sources that are clearly identified, including provisions that were
3 originally passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate and enacted in
4 the Public Law 23-26.
5 The Legislature finds that the Secretary of Finance transmitted a letter to
6 Governor Palacios on January 7, 2025, identifying general fund resources that
7 became available after satisfying the minimum annual payment to the Settlement
8 Fund from proceeds derived from the extension of the anticipated note with the
9 Bank of Guam for a total amount of $22,042,276, to appropriate to fully and
10 properly fund the restoration of work hours for our government employees across
11 all branches and instrumentalities of our government.
12 The Legislature further finds that appropriating general fund resources
13 identified within Public Law 23-26 is necessary to authorize and support the
14 Governor's Directive 2025-002. Through this legislation, the Legislature joins the
15 governor's decision to support the restoration of workforce hours in a fiscally
16 responsible manner. By redirecting available resources identified within Public
17 Law 23-26, this Act reestablishes income for households. An increase in the
18 spending power of our government workforce will increase the demand for goods
19 and commodities, circulating to businesses and leading to an increase in economic
20 activity and ultimately in tax revenues.
21 Based on the foregoing_reasons, the Legislature hereby amends the Fiscal
22 Year 2025 Budget Act (Public Law 23-26) by appropriating the balance of funds
23 reserved for the minimum annual payment administered by the Northern
24 Mariana Islands Settlement Fund for the purposes identified in this Act.

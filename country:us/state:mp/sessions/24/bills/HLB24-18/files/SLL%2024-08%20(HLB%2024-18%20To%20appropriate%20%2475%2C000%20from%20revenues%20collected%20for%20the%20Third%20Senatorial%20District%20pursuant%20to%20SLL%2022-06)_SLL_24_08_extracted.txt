Twenty-Fourth Northern Marianas Commonwealth Legislature
Saipan, MP 96950
Dear Mr. Chairman and Mr. Speaker:
This is to inform you that I have signed into law House Local Bill No. 24-18, entitled "To appropriate
$75,000.00 from revenues collected for the Third Senatorial District pursuant to Saipan Local Law
22-06; and for other purposes," which was passed by the Saipan and Northern Islands Legislative
Delegation of the Twenty-Fourth Northern Marianas Commonwealth Legislature.
I note that, though this bill contains a clause providing that it is enacted "[n]otwithstanding any
provision(s) of law. . . to the contrary," Saipan Local Law 22-06 contained a provision that the funds
it collected must first be allocated to maintain the Saipan Higher Education Financial Assistance
(SHEFA) student scholarship and operations accounts at levels of at least $3,000,000.00 and
$200,000.00, respectively.
Per a review of SHEFA account balances, see attached, though the funds are distributed among
numerous different accounts, the aggregate balance exceeds the threshold under Saipan Local Law 22-
06 and thus there is no conflict with this enactment.
This bill becomes Saipan Local Law No. 24-08. Copies bearing my signature are forwarded for your
reference.

The Honorable Edmund S. Villagomez

House of Representatives
Twenty-Fourth Northern Marianas Commonwealth Legislature
Saipan, MP 96950
Dear Mr. Chairman and Mr. Speaker:
This is to inform you that I have signed into law House Local Bill No. 24-18, entitled "To appropriate
$75,000.00 from revenues collected for the Third Senatorial District pursuant to Saipan Local Law
22-06; and for other purposes," which was passed by the Saipan and Northern Islands Legislative
Delegation of the Twenty-Fourth Northern Marianas Commonwealth Legislature.
I note that, though this bill contains a clause providing that it is enacted "[n]otwithstanding any
provision(s) of law. . . to the contrary," Saipan Local Law 22-06 contained a provision that the funds
it collected must first be allocated to maintain the Saipan Higher Education Financial Assistance
(SHEFA) student scholarship and operations accounts at levels of at least $3,000,000.00 and
$200,000.00, respectively.
Per a review of SHEFA account balances, see attached, though the funds are distributed among
numerous different accounts, the aggregate balance exceeds the threshold under Saipan Local Law 22-
06 and thus there is no conflict with this enactment.
This bill becomes Saipan Local Law No. 24-08. Copies bearing my signature are forwarded for your
reference.

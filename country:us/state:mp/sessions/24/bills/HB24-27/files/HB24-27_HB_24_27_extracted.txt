Section 1:
TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARLkNAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Session, 2025 H. B. 24- 1 1
To establish an excise tax for betelnut/areca nut and lime
mix/afoklor bweesch.
11
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24T NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Findings and Purpose. The Legislature acknowledges that the
2 chewing of betelnut/areca nut, often with lime mix/afok/or bweesch, is a tradition
3 shared across Pacific island communities, including the Commonwealth of the
4 Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). While culturally significant, the Legislature
5 finds that this practice, whether combined with tobacco or not, poses a serious
6 health concern as betelnut/areca nut classifies as a Group 1 carcinogenic risk to
7 humans according to the World Health Organization (2023). The traditional habit
8 of chewing betelnut/areca nut and lime mix/afok/or bweesch contributes to
9 heightening oral cancer incidence and deaths in the CNMI. Recent health data
10 underscores oral cancer as a pressing public health issue, evidencing a strong
11 connection to chewing and the consumption of betelnut/areca nut and associated
HOUSE BILL 24- ri
1 products.
2 Public Health Findings: In the United States, new cases of oral cancer in
3 2024 amounted to 3% of total recorded cancer cases, and 2% of overall cancer
4 deaths were due to oral cancer (National Cancer for Health Statistics, 2024). Local
5 data finds oral cancer as the second most frequently diagnosed cancer in the CNMI,
6 closely trailing breast cancer. Data recorded by the. Cancer Registry shows an
7 average of 20 diagnosed cases annually between 2018 and 2023 with cases growing
8 at a concerning average rate of 26.19% per year. Demographics reveal that 68% of
9 patients are Chamorro or Carolinian, rising to 89% when including other
10 Micronesians (Pacific Regional Central Cancer Registry, 2025). Mortality
11 statistics further reveal the grave impact of oral cancer, accounting for 20% of all
12 cancer deaths in 2023 and 16% in 2024, with lip, oral cavity, and pharynx cancers
13 representing over half of the 2024 cancer deaths for individuals ages 40-59 years
14 (CHCC Health & Vital Statistics, 2025).
15 Dental screenings also reflect the prevalence of the disease with 35% of
16 screened and biopsied individuals at the CHCC Dental Clinic alone testing positive
17 for oral cancer all identified as habitual chewers of betelnut/areca nut and lime
18 mix/afok/or bweesch (Sabino, 2025). Oral cancer screenings are vital for
19 prevention, early detection, and treatment. However, screening rates remain
20 alarmingly low. Less than half of surveyed adults in the CNMI reported a dental
21 visit within the last year, while nearly 8% stated they had never had one (CHCC
2
HOUSE BILL 24- t ei
1 Non-Communicable Disease Programs, 2023). Moreover, the CHCC Oncology
2 Clinic, the CNMI' s only center providing care for people at risk of cancer, being
3 treated for cancer, and living with cancer after treatment, report that the majority of
4 their oral cancer patients were diagnosed only after presenting symptoms of
5 advanced-stage cancer, specifically stages 3 and 4. Every oral cancer patient treated
6 at the clinic was also found to be a frequent chewer of betelnut/areca nut and lime
7 mix/afok/or bweesch (Brett & Hofschneider, 2025).
8 The Legislature further finds that oral cancer is characterized by devastating
9 consequences for affected individuals, including physical suffering - often inclusive
10 of disfigurement resulting from surgical treatment, emotional distress and
11 depression, reduced quality of life and lifespan, and financial burdens on families
12 and the community. Furthermore, late screening and diagnosis continue to lead to
13 persistently high mortality rates for the CNMI. This highlights the urgent need for
14 prevention and early interventions to detect and treat oral cancer during its earlier
15 stages, specifically stages 1 and 2. Moreover, the high financial cost of treating
16 advanced stages of oral cancer places a substantial strain on the CNMI's only
17 hospital and healthcare system, diverting critical resources from other vital health
18 priorities and jeopardizing the sustainability of comprehensive care provision.
19 Economic Implications: The Legislature recognizes imported
20 betelnut/areca nut and lime mix/afoldor bweesch are readily accessible in many
21 local stores, driving persistent demand. The proposed legislation seeks to tax only
3
HOUSE BILL 24- 2.1
1 imported betelnut/areca nut and related products, encouraging healthier choices and
2 behaviors among consumers. The tax also reduces access to and reliance on these
3 imported items, aiming to lower the prevalence of oral cancer and alleviate the
4 associated healthcare burdens in the CNMI. Beyond deterrence, the tax also
5 provides a vital opportunity to generate revenue for public health and clinical
6 initiatives to combat oral cancer and its impacts. Revenue from the tax would
7 bolster prevention campaigns, community incentive programs, early screening and
8 detection initiatives, and treatment options, supporting CHCC mandates and
9 creating a positive feedback loop for a sustainable pathway to improved health
10 outcomes.
11 The Legislature also realizes the potential economic impact on businesses
12 importing betelnut/areca nut and lime mix/afok/bweesch. The excise tax may lead
13 to pricing adjustments and shifts in consumer demand, potentially affecting the
14 revenue of these businesses. To balance significant public health priorities and
15 concerns with economic considerations, the Legislature encourages affected
16 businesses to explore opportunities for diversification or transition to alternative
17 products that align with CNMI public health goals. Through this legislation, the
18 CNMI can take a timely and decisive step to address critical public health goals,
19 providing a sustainable path for supporting the CNMI's healthcare system and
20 promoting long-term health outcomes for the community. Therefore, the purpose
21 of this Act is to establish an excise tax for imported betelnut/areca nut and lime

TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARLkNAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Session, 2025 H. B. 24- 1 1
A BILL FOR AN ACT
To establish an excise tax for betelnut/areca nut and lime
mix/afoklor bweesch.
11
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24T NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Findings and Purpose. The Legislature acknowledges that the
2 chewing of betelnut/areca nut, often with lime mix/afok/or bweesch, is a tradition
3 shared across Pacific island communities, including the Commonwealth of the
4 Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). While culturally significant, the Legislature
5 finds that this practice, whether combined with tobacco or not, poses a serious
6 health concern as betelnut/areca nut classifies as a Group 1 carcinogenic risk to
7 humans according to the World Health Organization (2023). The traditional habit
8 of chewing betelnut/areca nut and lime mix/afok/or bweesch contributes to
9 heightening oral cancer incidence and deaths in the CNMI. Recent health data
10 underscores oral cancer as a pressing public health issue, evidencing a strong
11 connection to chewing and the consumption of betelnut/areca nut and associated

HOUSE BILL 24- ri
1 products.
2 Public Health Findings: In the United States, new cases of oral cancer in
3 2024 amounted to 3% of total recorded cancer cases, and 2% of overall cancer
4 deaths were due to oral cancer (National Cancer for Health Statistics, 2024). Local
5 data finds oral cancer as the second most frequently diagnosed cancer in the CNMI,
6 closely trailing breast cancer. Data recorded by the. Cancer Registry shows an
7 average of 20 diagnosed cases annually between 2018 and 2023 with cases growing
8 at a concerning average rate of 26.19% per year. Demographics reveal that 68% of
9 patients are Chamorro or Carolinian, rising to 89% when including other
10 Micronesians (Pacific Regional Central Cancer Registry, 2025). Mortality
11 statistics further reveal the grave impact of oral cancer, accounting for 20% of all
12 cancer deaths in 2023 and 16% in 2024, with lip, oral cavity, and pharynx cancers
13 representing over half of the 2024 cancer deaths for individuals ages 40-59 years
14 (CHCC Health & Vital Statistics, 2025).
15 Dental screenings also reflect the prevalence of the disease with 35% of
16 screened and biopsied individuals at the CHCC Dental Clinic alone testing positive
17 for oral cancer all identified as habitual chewers of betelnut/areca nut and lime
18 mix/afok/or bweesch (Sabino, 2025). Oral cancer screenings are vital for
19 prevention, early detection, and treatment. However, screening rates remain
20 alarmingly low. Less than half of surveyed adults in the CNMI reported a dental
21 visit within the last year, while nearly 8% stated they had never had one (CHCC
2

HOUSE BILL 24- t ei
1 Non-Communicable Disease Programs, 2023). Moreover, the CHCC Oncology
2 Clinic, the CNMI' s only center providing care for people at risk of cancer, being
3 treated for cancer, and living with cancer after treatment, report that the majority of
4 their oral cancer patients were diagnosed only after presenting symptoms of
5 advanced-stage cancer, specifically stages 3 and 4. Every oral cancer patient treated
6 at the clinic was also found to be a frequent chewer of betelnut/areca nut and lime
7 mix/afok/or bweesch (Brett & Hofschneider, 2025).
8 The Legislature further finds that oral cancer is characterized by devastating
9 consequences for affected individuals, including physical suffering - often inclusive
10 of disfigurement resulting from surgical treatment, emotional distress and
11 depression, reduced quality of life and lifespan, and financial burdens on families
12 and the community. Furthermore, late screening and diagnosis continue to lead to
13 persistently high mortality rates for the CNMI. This highlights the urgent need for
14 prevention and early interventions to detect and treat oral cancer during its earlier
15 stages, specifically stages 1 and 2. Moreover, the high financial cost of treating
16 advanced stages of oral cancer places a substantial strain on the CNMI's only
17 hospital and healthcare system, diverting critical resources from other vital health
18 priorities and jeopardizing the sustainability of comprehensive care provision.
19 Economic Implications: The Legislature recognizes imported
20 betelnut/areca nut and lime mix/afoldor bweesch are readily accessible in many
21 local stores, driving persistent demand. The proposed legislation seeks to tax only
3

HOUSE BILL 24- 2.1
1 imported betelnut/areca nut and related products, encouraging healthier choices and
2 behaviors among consumers. The tax also reduces access to and reliance on these
3 imported items, aiming to lower the prevalence of oral cancer and alleviate the
4 associated healthcare burdens in the CNMI. Beyond deterrence, the tax also
5 provides a vital opportunity to generate revenue for public health and clinical
6 initiatives to combat oral cancer and its impacts. Revenue from the tax would
7 bolster prevention campaigns, community incentive programs, early screening and
8 detection initiatives, and treatment options, supporting CHCC mandates and
9 creating a positive feedback loop for a sustainable pathway to improved health
10 outcomes.
11 The Legislature also realizes the potential economic impact on businesses
12 importing betelnut/areca nut and lime mix/afok/bweesch. The excise tax may lead
13 to pricing adjustments and shifts in consumer demand, potentially affecting the
14 revenue of these businesses. To balance significant public health priorities and
15 concerns with economic considerations, the Legislature encourages affected
16 businesses to explore opportunities for diversification or transition to alternative
17 products that align with CNMI public health goals. Through this legislation, the
18 CNMI can take a timely and decisive step to address critical public health goals,
19 providing a sustainable path for supporting the CNMI's healthcare system and
20 promoting long-term health outcomes for the community. Therefore, the purpose
21 of this Act is to establish an excise tax for imported betelnut/areca nut and lime

TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Regular Session, 2025 H. B. 2 4' iti
A BILL FOR AN ACT
To establish regulations on vehicle window tinting for safety and
security in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands;
and for other purposes.

BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24T NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Findings and Purpose. The Legislature recognizes that, in the
2 Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, vehicle window tinting plays a
3 significant role in enhancing vehicle appearance while also impacting safety and
4 security. Properly regulated tinting can provide protection from the sun's heat and
5 ultraviolet rays, prevent interior heat damage, reduce glare from sunlight and
6 headlights, and improve privacy. These benefits contribute to safer driving
7 conditions and help prevent theft by obscuring valuables inside the vehicle.
8 Currently, the CNMI has limited regulations regarding window tinting, with
9 only two statutory provisions: (1) 1 CMC § 7406(e), which restricts tinting on
10 government vehicles, except for unmarked law enforcement vehicles and those
11 used by elected officials and judges; and (2) 1 CMC § 2596(a)(5), which bans
12 adhesive or spray tinting on taxicab windows.

HOUSE BILL
1 However, the lack of comprehensive regulation has led to widespread
2 unregulated tinting that poses significant safety hazards. Excessively dark or
3 improperly installed tint can greatly diminish visibility, especially at night or during
4 bad weather, increasing the risk of accidents. Additionally, heavily tinted windows
5 can conceal illegal activities, creating dangers for the public and law enforcement
6 officers alike who may approach vehicles unknowingly involved in illegal conduct.
7 Most U.S. states and territories have enacted their own regulations to
8 promote safety and public security through controlled window tinting standards.
9 The Department of Public Safety in the CNMI has repeatedly emphasized the
10 urgent need for such regulations to protect all road users.
11 Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to establish clear, effective, and
12 enforceable regulations on vehicle window tinting in the Commonwealth of the
13 Northern Mariana Islands, with the primary objectives of enhancing road safety,
14 safeguarding public security, and ensuring lawful conduct on the roads.
15 Section 2. Amendment. Title 9, Division 4, Chapter 1 of the
16 Commonwealth Code is amended by inserting a new § 4116 to read as follows:
17 "§ 4116. Window Tinting.
18 (a) Tinting Material. Notwithstanding 1 CMC § 2596(a)(5) and 1 CMC §
19 7406(e), a person may apply tinting material to the windows of a motor vehicle in
20 compliance with this section.
21 (1) Tinting material may be applied to the side and rear windows of
22 a motor vehicle if:
23 (i) The visible light transmittance (VLT) of the tinting
24 material is 35% or more; and

1 (ii) The total light transmittance through the window with
2 the tint applied is 35% or more.
3 (2) Tinting material with lower light transmittance than permitted
4 under subsection (a)(1) may be applied to the top six inches of a windshield
5 only. No other part of the windshield may be tinted.
6 (3) Tinting material with lower transmittance than allowed under
7 subsection (a)(1) may be applied to all windows behind the driver of a
8 multipurpose passenger vehicle, provided the vehicle has exterior rearview
9 mirrors on each side. The tinted windows must meet federal regulations for
10 glazing material. For this subsection, a "multipurpose passenger vehicle" is
11 defined as a motor vehicle designed to carry up to 10 persons, built on a
12 truck chassis or with features for occasional off-road use.
13 (4) Tinting material with lower transmittance than permitted under
14 subsection (a)(1) may also be applied to side and rear windows of a vehicle
15 registered to a person or their legal guardian if accompanied by a written
16 document signed by a licensed physician or practitioner stating that the
17 person or someone in their household has a medical condition requiring
18 tinting with lower transmittance. Acceptable documents include:
19 (i) An affidavit;
20 (ii) A prescription; or
21 (iii) A letter on the practitioner's letterhead
22 (5) This documentation must be kept in the vehicle and shown to a
23 police officer upon request regarding the tint.
24 (6) There are no light transmittance requirments for glazing on AS-
25 3 type windows.
26 (7) The following types of tinting material are not permitted:
27 (i) Mirror finish products;
28 (ii) Red, gold, yellow, amber or black tint; and
3

HOUSE BILL
1 (iii) Liquid tint applied by brushing or spraying.
2 (8) Each person installing window tinting must provide the vehicle
3 owner with a certificate that includes:
4 (i) The name and address of the installer;
5 (ii) The light transmittance of the tint;
6 (iii) The light reflectance of the tint; and
7 (iv) A statement that the total light transmittance through
8 each tinted window is at least 35%.
9 (9) The certificate must be kept in the vehicle and shown to an
10 officer when asked about the tint.
11 (10) For purposes of this section, Visible Light Transmission (VLT)
12 is the percentage of total visible light passing through the material, relative
13 to the total light falling on it.
14 (b) Illegal Window Tinting. It is unlawful to apply window tinting material
15 that does not comply with subsection (a), or to tint windows on a vehicle where
16 tinting is not authorized under this section.
17 (c) Violation and Penalty. Any violation of this section is an infraction,
18 punishable by a fine of up to $250 for the first offense and up to $500 for subsequent
19 offenses. Violators must correct the tinting and have the vehicle re-inspected within
20 10 days at a Certified Safety Inspection Station as defined in 9 CMC § 3107.
21 (d) Inspection and Enforcement. The Department of Public Safety and
22 Certified Safety Inspection Stations shall enforce and ensure compliance with this
23 Act.
24 (e) Exemption.
25 (1) This section does not apply to unmarked law enforcement
26 vehicles or official vehicles used, owned, leased, or assigned to the
27 Governor, Lieutenant Governor, or other elected officials, as defined in 1

3 Section 3. Transition. A motor vehicle not in compliance with Section
4 2 of this Act shall be made in compliance within one year after this Act
5 becomes law.
6 Section 4. Severability. If any provisions of this Act or the application of
7 any such provision to any person or circumstance should be held invalid by a court
8 of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this Act or the application of its
9 provisions to persons or circumstances other than those to which it is held invalid
10 shall not be affected thereby.
11 Section 5. Savings Clause. This Act and any repealer contained herein
12 shall not be construed as affecting any existing right acquired under contract or
13 acquired under statutes repealed or under any rule, regulation, or order adopted
14 under the statutes. Repealers contained in this Act shall not affect any proceeding
15 instituted under or pursuant to prior law. The enactment of the Act shall not have

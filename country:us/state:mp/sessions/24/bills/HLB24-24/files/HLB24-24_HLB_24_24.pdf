A LOCAL BILL FOR AN ACT
FOR THE FIRST SENATORIAL DISTRICT
To establish the Rota Department of Public Works equipment
rental fee, and for other purposes.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE FIRST SENATORIAL DISTRICT
DELEGATION PURSUANT TO CHAPTER 4, DIVISION 1, TITLE 1 OF
THE COMMONWEALTH CODE:
1 SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
2 The Legislature finds that the Rota Department of Public Works (Rota
3 DPW) plays a vital role in maintaining the island's infrastructure, including roads,
4 public facilities, and other essential community services. In the course of its
5 operations, the Department owns and maintains various types of heavy equipment
6 and machinery to support both public and private projects.
7 The Legislature further finds that maintenance, fueling, and operational
8 costs of this equipment are significant, and current funding is limited. Allowing the
9 Department to charge reasonable fees for the use of its equipment will not only help
10 offset operational costs but also ensure that such equipment remains available and
11 in good working condition for the benefit of the Rota community.
12 The purpose of this Act is to authorize the collection of equipment-use fees,

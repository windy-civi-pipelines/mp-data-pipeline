To establish revolving accounts for the Department of Lands &
Natural Resources; and for other purposes.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24™ NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Findings and Purpose. The Legislature finds that the Division
2 of Land Registration & Survey (DLRS), under the Department of Lands & Natural
3 Resources (DLNR), is mandated by Public Law 3-79 to survey pre-war properties,
4 record documentation and maps, review and clear all submitted check prints, and
5 provide research services to the general public on a daily basis. Furthermore, they
6 conduct land surveys and plats, hold hearings on disputed land claims, issue
7 certificates of title, record such certificates and other documents with the
8 Commonwealth recorder, and so forth. Despite providing these services, the DLRS
9 does not charge fees after producing requested documentation. Cognizant of their
10 ability to implement fees within their respective regulations, the Legislature finds
11 that it would be appropriate to establish a revolving account where all funds
12 collected pursuant to such enacted regulations can be deposited. Upon
$ /
HOUSE BILL 24- -----
1 promulgation, the proposed revolving account will be able to collect and deposit
2 fees that can be utilized to fund personnel, operations, and other related costs.
3 The Legislature also finds that, pursuant to 3 CMC §2624(b), DLNR shall
4 have general supervision over all public cemeteries, including ground maintenance,
5 coordination of burial activities, and further improvements to all public cemeteries
6 as required by law. Furthermore, pursuant to 3 CMC §2622, Lot 053 A 52
7 containing approximately 25,350 square meters; Lot 053 A 26 containing
8 approximately 20,843 square meters; and Lot 053 A 29 containing approximately
9 23,226 square meters were transferred to DLNR for the purpose of establishing a
10 new public cemetery in Marpi. As the department with general supervision
11 authority over public cemeteries, the Legislature finds that it would be appropriate
12 to allow the Secretary of DLNR to serve as the expenditure authority for all funds
13 collected from public cemetery-related matters.
14 Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to establish a revolving account for the
15 Division of Land Registration & Survey (DLRS), and for other purposes.

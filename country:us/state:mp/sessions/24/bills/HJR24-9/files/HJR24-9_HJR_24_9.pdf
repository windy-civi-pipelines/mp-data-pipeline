TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
24 -q
SESSION, 2025 H. J. R.
A HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION
To respectfully urge the United States Department of the Treasury,
United States Customs and Border Protection, the United States
Postal Service and any other responsible federal agencies to
immediately cease and desist the implementation of Executive
Order 14324 and remit to the Commonwealth of the Northern
Mariana Islands all revenues collected under Executive Order
14324, or in the alternative, to recognize the CNMI' s authority to
collect such revenues itself consistent with the Covenant and
applicable law in the event that said charges must be imposed.
1 WHEREAS, the suspension of duty-free treatment under Executive Order
2 14324 has placed an immediate and disproportionate burden on the people of the
3 Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands by increasing the cost of imported
4 goods, in a jurisdiction where nearly all food, medicine, clothing, school supplies,
5 and household necessities are imported, and where the misapplication of duties
6 directly raises costs for families and small businesses, causing severe adverse
7 effects on a population that already bears some of the highest importation costs in
8 the United States; and
9 WHEREAS, Executive Order 14324, issued on August 29, 2025, suspends
10 the "de minimis" duty-free treatment for imported goods valued under $800, and

HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION
1 federal agencies have applied this order to shipments either bound for the CNMI or
2 originating from the CNMI, even though the Commonwealth is outside the United
3 States Customs Territory and therefore not subject to Executive Order 14324; and
4 WHEREAS, Section 603(a) of the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth
5 of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of
6 America, Pub. L. No. 94-241, codified at 48 U.S.C. ยง 1801 et seq., provides that
7 any duties, tariffs, or taxes assessed on shipments bound for or originating from the
8 Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands are not subject to United States
9 Customs, taxes, or duties and therefore should immediately cease and desist
10 because Executive Order 14324 is not applicable to the Commonwealth; and
11 WHEREAS, because Section 603(a) of the Covenant provides that
12 shipments bound for or originating from the CNMI are outside the U.S. Customs
13 Territory, then to the extent any duties are improperly assessed, such revenues must
14 be remitted in full to the CNMI treasury or collected directly by the CNMI
15 government itself, consistent with federal law; and
16 WHEREAS, because the CNMI is not part of the U.S. Customs Territory
17 under applicable federal law, shipments destined for Saipan, Tinian, and Rota must
18 not be subjected to the tariffs imposed by Executive Order 14324 even if they are
19 routed through mainland United States ports, Hawai`i, Guam, or Puerto Rico, as
20 those goods are not intended for sale or consumption within the Customs Territory;

HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION
1 WHEREAS, packages shipped from the CNMI to other United States
2 jurisdictions are also being misclassified as subject to Executive Order 14324, even
3 though the CNMI is legally recognized as United States in origin under the
4 Covenant, and therefore such CNMI-origin goods must not be subjected to duties
5 or fees that do not lawfully apply; and
6 WHEREAS, this misapplication of Executive Order 14324 undermines the
7 Covenant, disregards the Commonwealth's unique political and economic status,
8 and unjustly burdens the daily lives of CNMI families and the survival of small
9 businesses, which are the heart of the islands;
10 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of
11 Representatives of the Twenty-Fourth Northern Marianas Commonwealth
12 Legislature, the Senate concurring that, pursuant to Section 603(a) of the Covenant
13 to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union
14 with the United States of America, Executive Order 14324 is not applicable to the
15 Commonwealth and therefore, any duties, tariffs, taxes, or importation fees
16 assessed on shipments bound for or originating from the CNMI must immediately
17 cease and desist; provided, however, that to the extent such charges are collected,
18 they shall be remitted in full to the treasury of the Commonwealth of the Northern
19 Mariana Islands, or be collected directly by the CNMI government itself whenever
20 legally proper so that such revenues remain with the people of the Commonwealth
21 consistent with the Covenant and applicable law; and

HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION
that consistent with applicable United
1 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED,
2 States federal law, the CNMI shall receive immediate relief from the misapplication
3 of Executive Order 14324, which has imposed disproportionate burdens on CNMI
4 families and small businesses, by exempting all shipments ultimately bound for the
5 CNMI from the application of Executive Order 14324, even if temporarily routed
6 through the mainland United States, Hawai`i, Guam, or Puerto Rico, as such
7 shipments are not intended for sale or consumption within the United States
8 Customs Territory; and
9 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all United States federal entities
10 including but not limited to the United States Postal Service, United States Customs
11 and Border Protection, and the United States Department of the Treasury shall
12 immediately treat and acknowledge packages shipped from the CNMI to other
13 United States jurisdictions, as exempt from the application of Executive Order
14 14324 because they originate from a Commonwealth of the United States; and
15 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Speaker of the House of
16 Representatives and the President of the Senate shall certify and the House Clerk
17 and the Senate Legislative Secretary shall attest to the adoption of this joint
18 resolution and thereafter the House Clerk shall transmit a certified copy to the
19 President of the United States, Donald J. Trump; the Secretary of the Treasury,
20 Scott Bessent; the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Rodney
21 S. Scott; the Honorable Kimberlyn King-Hinds, Delegate to the 119th United States

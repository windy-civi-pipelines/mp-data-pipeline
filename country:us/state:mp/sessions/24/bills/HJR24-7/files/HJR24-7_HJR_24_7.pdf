<c)J10 0( SESSION, 2025 H. J. R.
A HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION
To encourage the Honorable David M. Apatang, Governor of the
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, to declare a
Proactive Resilience Emergency Declaration to protect the
Commonwealth's renewable energy future in light of the
approaching federal deadline under the 2025 "Big Beautiful
Budget" Act (BBB); and urging all agencies to fast-tract renewable
energy projects before the opportunity expires.
1 WHEREAS, the 2025 "Big Beautiful Budget" (BBB) Act phases out
2 federal clean energy tax credits and grants unless renewable energy projects are
3 awarded by September 30, 2025, and commence by December 31, 2025, a deadline
4 that could determine the fate of the CNMI' s energy future; and
5 WHEREAS, the Commonwealth has long struggled with high energy costs
6 (more than three times the U.S. average) due to a near-total reliance on imported
7 diesel fuel, with Tinian and Rota facing even greater challenges due to limited
8 shipping, high transport costs, and unreliable supply chains; and
9 WHEREAS, the Commonwealth Utilities Corporation (CUC) reported in
10 its Fiscal Year 2023 Citizen-Centric Report that production fuel costs for power
11 generation alone totaled $67+million, which is paid by the CNMI community as

HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION
1 the "fuel surcharge", underscoring the immense financial burden of the
2 Commonwealth's continued reliance on expensive imported fuel; and
3 WHEREAS, energy is an economic driving force for the CNMI
4 community, powering critical infrastructure, businesses, and daily life, and
5 achieving lower energy costs and greater energy security is vital to the
6 Commonwealth's economic stability and growth; and
7 WHEREAS, now more than ever, we must act not in fear, but with
8 Proactive Resilience, making forward-thinking choices to secure affordable, stable
9 power for our families, protect our environment, create local jobs, and safeguard
10 our children's future; and
11 WHEREAS, several major renewable energy projects across Saipan,
12 Tinian, and Rota — including public school solar installations, a Commonwealth
13 Utilities Corporation solar farm, and energy resilience upgrades at ports, clinics,
14 and water systems — are "shovel-ready" but stalled in paperwork and risk
15 cancellation if not accelerated before the federal window closes; and
16 WHEREAS, the CNMI Constitution and emergency management laws
17 empower the Governor to issue official directives or declarations to address "other
18 calamities" — including economic and energy crises that endanger the public good;
19 and
20 WHEREAS, previous administrations have invoked emergency
21 declarations to stabilize essential utilities and critical infrastructure in times of

HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION
1 crisis, thereby establishing a precedent for such extraordinary measures to
2 safeguard the public welfare; and
3 WHEREAS, today the Commonwealth faces a similar inflection point not
4 caused by a natural disaster but by shifting federal policy, which threatens our long-
5 term energy stability and requires a proactive, unified response; and
6 WHEREAS, a "Proactive Resilience Emergency Declaration" will enable
7 the Governor to: Fast-track project approvals and permitting; Coordinate a whole-
8 of-government response; Reprogram resources to meet urgent deadlines; And send
9 a strong, unifying message that we are taking control of our energy destiny before
10 others decide it for us;
11 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the House of
12 Representatives of the Twenty-Fourth Northern Marianas Commonwealth
13 Legislature, the Senate concurring, that the House and Senate respectfully
14 encourages Governor David M. Apatang to issue a Proactive Resilience
15 Emergency Declaration in response to the approaching BBB Act deadlines,
16 empowering agencies and communities to complete federally eligible clean energy
17 projects in time; and
18 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the House and Senate urges all
19 Commonwealth government agencies, departments, and public corporations to
20 pursue lower energy costs by immediately prioritizing, coordinating, and

TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Regular Session, 2025 H. B. 24- 70
A BILL FOR AN ACT
To amend certain provisions of the CNMI Good Samaritan Act
[7 CMC § 2801 et seq.]; and for other purposes.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24TH NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Findings and Purpose: The Legislature finds that the opioid
2 overdose epidemic continues to grow in the United States. According the Centers
3 for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 750,000 people have died since 1999
4 from a drug overdose. Two out of three drug overdose deaths in 2018 involved an
5 opioid. Opioids are substances that work in the nervous system of the body or in
6 specific receptors in the brain to reduce the intensity of pain. Overdose deaths
7 involving opioids, including prescription opioids, heroin, and synthetic opioids
8 (like fentanyl), have increased almost six times since 1999. Overdoses involving
9 opioids killed nearly 47,000 people in 2018, and 32% of those deaths involved
10 prescription opioids.
11 Many of these negative outcomes are preventable. Opioid overdose is
12 reversible through the timely administration of an opioid overdose reversal

HOUSE BILL 24- 3S
1 medication including naloxone and, where needed, the provision of other
2 emergency care. However, community access to opioid overdose reversal
3 medication including naloxone is limited by laws and regulations that pre-date the
4 overdose epidemic. At the urging of organizations including the U.S. Conference
5 of Mayors, the American Medical Association, the American Public Health
6 Association, and the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, all states have
7 removed some legal barriers to the seeking of emergency medical care and the
8 timely administration of naloxone. These changes come in two general varieties.
9 The first improves the availability of naloxone, typically by permitting it to be
10 prescribed to people other than the person at risk of overdose or otherwise removing
11 the need for a person to see a prescriber before obtaining the medication. The
12 second encourages bystanders to become "Good Samaritans" by summoning
13 emergency responders without fear of arrest or other negative legal consequences.
14 In an attempt to reverse the unprecedented increase in preventable overdose
15 deaths, most states have also modified criminal law to provide limited immunity to
16 individuals who seek help in an overdose emergency. The Legislature intends to
17 encourage family members, friends, bystanders and first responders including
18 emergency service employees, firefighters, police officers or other law enforcement
19 officers, EMT, Advanced EMT, and paramedics to administer opioid overdose
20 reversal medication to drug overdose victims through the establishment of limited

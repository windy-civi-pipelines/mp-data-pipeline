TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Session, 2025 H. B. 24- V.
A BILL FOR AN ACT
To establish a Prescription Drug Monitoring Program in the
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands; and for other
purposes.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24TH NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Findings and Purpose. Commonwealth healthcare providers
2 face increasing challenges in ensuring the safe and effective use of Prescription
3 Drugs. The Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation (CHCC) operates the only
4 hospital and emergency room in the CNMI and oversees clinics, pharmacies, and
5 public health programs across Saipan, Tinian, and Rota. As the largest network of
6 Prescribers and Dispensers in the Commonwealth, CHCC is uniquely suited to
7 manage and operate a Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP).
8 Having access to accurate prescription history helps protect Patient safety
9 and improve treatment decisions. PDMPs enable healthcare providers to review a
10 Patient's current medications before prescribing or dispensing. This prevents
11 unnecessary duplication, alerts providers to possible Drug interactions, and helps
12 identify Patients who may be at risk of Misuse or substance use disorder.

V•
HOUSE BILL 24-
1 Considerable effort has gone into developing a comprehensive PDMP
2 framework for the CNMI because the ability to monitor prescribing and dispensing
3 trends is also critical to the Commonwealth's public health planning and response.
4 The first legislative proposal was introduced as House Bill 22-68 during the 22nd
5 Legislature. A revised version was later prepared and reviewed but not formally
6 filed. This Act builds upon those earlier efforts, reflecting lessons learned and input
7 gathered over the past several years to produce a more complete and operationally
8 ready bill.
9 Committed to a solution that works for the CNMI, the Legislature ultimately
10 crafted a PDMP that reflects local needs, capacities, and healthcare structure. This
11 Act establishes a CHCC-administered monitoring system grounded in
12 Commonwealth law, aligned with national standards, and customized for our
13 unique geographic and public health conditions.
14 Section 2. Enactment. The following provision is hereby enacted as a new
15 Chapter 12 of Division 2, Title 3 of the Commonwealth Code, to be codified as

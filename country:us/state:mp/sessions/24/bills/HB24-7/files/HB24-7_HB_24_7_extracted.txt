Section 1:
TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
First Regular Session, 2025 H. B. 24- fil
To ensure that the expenditure authority designated in the
Annual Appropriation Act retains authority over all funds
appropriated to it.
11
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24T NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Findings. The Separation of Powers doctrine mandates that the
2 Commonwealth government consists of three co-equal and independent branches:
3 the Legislature, which enacts laws; the Executive, which enforces laws; and the
4 Judiciary, which interprets laws. To function effectively and prevent undue
5 influence, each branch must maintain fiscal autonomy and control over its
6 appropriated funds.
7 To uphold this principle, this Act establishes the Legislature Operations
8 Fund and Judicial Operations Fund, ensuring financial independence for both
9 branches. The CNMI Constitution explicitly mandates a system of government
10 composed of three co-equal and independent branches—Legislative, Executive,
11 and Judicial—each with distinct responsibilities and powers. Articles II, III, and IV
12 of the Constitution enshrine this principle, preventing any one branch from exerting
HOUSE BILL 24- 1
1 undue control over another.
2 The Judiciary already exercises a degree of fiscal autonomy, as it has been
3 delegated authority by the Secretary of Finance to oversee its appropriations and
4 manage its expenditures. However, the Legislature has not been granted such
5 authority, leaving it reliant on the Executive Branch for financial control over its
6 operations.
7 This disparity creates an imbalance that this Act seeks to correct by ensuring
8 that both the Judiciary and the Legislature have full control over their respective
9 budgets. These funds will be managed separately, with independent financial
10 records and bank accounts, and appropriations will be allotted quarterly to maintain
11 stability and predictability. By maintaining financial independence, each branch
12 can effectively fulfill its constitutional responsibilities without reliance on, or
13 interference from, another branch.
14 Furthermore, this Act guarantees a minimum appropriation of 9% of
15 available funds for the Legislature and 7% for the Judiciary. Each branch will have
16 full expenditure authority over its respective fund, aligning with established fiscal
17 practices of autonomous agencies. While the Legislative Bureau and Judiciary will
18 manage their funds, they will also adhere to general accounting principles and
19 submit financial reports to the Department of Finance for transparency, ensuring
20 responsible financial oversight without undermining autonomy.
21 To prevent executive overreach, this Act prohibits unilateral
2

HOUSE BILL 24-
1 impoundments, budget reductions, or reallocations that could compromise the
2 financial independence of the Judiciary and Legislature. Any changes to
3 appropriations, including reductions, must be enacted through legislative
4 amendments rather than executive actions, ensuring that fiscal decision-making
5 remains a shared responsibility among co-equal branches of government.
6 Background and Predecessor Legislation: House Bill 23-27
7 House Bill 23-27 was introduced on March 9, 2023, by Representative
8 Joseph A. Flores in response to growing concerns that the Executive Branch had
9 overstepped its constitutional boundaries by exerting excessive control over
10 legislative and judicial appropriations. Historically, the Executive Branch has
11 exercised broad discretion over budget allocations, including the ability to withhold
12 or reprogram funds appropriated to the Judiciary and Legislature. This practice
13 raised constitutional concerns, as it effectively placed financial decision-making
14 authority in the hands of the Executive, undermining the independence of the other
15 two branches.
16 To address this imbalance, House Bill 23-27 explicitly prohibited the
17 Executive Branch from impounding, reprogramming, or otherwise restricting funds
18 already appropriated to the Judiciary and Legislature. By doing so, it sought to
19 reinforce the principle that each branch of government must have direct and
20 unimpeded access to the resources necessary to fulfill its constitutional duties.
21 Building upon this foundation, this Act strengthens and codifies these
3
-
HOUSE BILL 24- /
1 protections to ensure that fiscal autonomy remains a permanent safeguard against
2 undue executive interference.
3 The Judiciary strongly supported HB 23-27, recognizing that financial
4 independence is essential to upholding its constitutional role and ensuring an
5 impartial and effective judicial system. In comments submitted by Chief Justice
6 Alexandro C. Castro and Presiding Judge Roberto C. Naraja, the Judiciary
7 emphasized:
8 "Under Article IV of the NMI Constitution, the Judiciary is unequivocally
9 acknowledged as a co-equal, independent branch of government. Sections 3, 4, 5,
10 and 6 of House Bill 23-27 recognize this independence, particularly as to the
11 Judiciary's fiscal authority. The ability to exercise independent fiscal decision-
12 making is a necessity to uphold the rule of law, maintain public confidence, and
13 prevent encroachment by another branch. For these reasons, the Judiciary fully
14 supports the passage of House Bill No. 23-27." (Judiciary Comments, April 13,
15 2023)
16 By codifying and strengthening these principles, this Act ensures that fiscal
17 autonomy remains protected as a cornerstone of government accountability and
18 separation of powers.
19 Rebuttal to the Attorney General's Opinion on HB 23-27
20 The CNMI Attorney General contended that HB 23-27 conflicts with
21 constitutional provisions related to budget ceilings and financial control under
4
HOUSE BILL 24- T,
1 Article X, Section 8. However, these claims misinterpret the intent of the
2 Constitution and the necessity of fiscal autonomy within a system of checks and
3 balances.
4 First, the claim that the legislative budget ceiling would be violated is
5 speculative. This Act does not automatically exceed the constitutional ceiling, as
6 any adjustments remain subject to the limitations of Article II, Section 16. The
7 Legislature retains the authority to amend budgetary frameworks within
8 constitutional constraints, making the concern unfounded.
9 Second, the assertion that Article X, Section 8 grants the Department of
10 Finance exclusive control over public funds is an overreach. The provision was
11 intended to ensure financial oversight, not to consolidate financial control under the
12 Executive Branch. If this interpretation were correct, existing statutory provisions
13 that grant expenditure authority to the Judiciary and Legislature would be
14 unconstitutional, which they are not.
15 The Second Constitutional Convention, which added Article X, Section 8,
16 aimed to promote financial accountability, not to subordinate the Judiciary and
17 Legislature to the Executive Branch. The Attorney General's interpretation
18 conflicts with statutory provisions that allow for separate branches to control their
19 budgets. Given its inconsistency with the Separation of Powers doctrine, it is clear
20 that the Attorney General Opinion does not directly contradict the intent of this bill.
21
5
2417
HOUSE BILL
1 Article X, Section 8 should be read and applied to better align with the
2 Constitution's foundational principles that allow for Legislative and Judicial
3 autonomy. The 1985 Second Constitutional Convention introduced Proposed
4 Amendment 31, which added Section 8 to Article X of the CNMI Constitution. The
5 primary intent of this amendment was to ensure financial accountability by
6 regulating specific expenditures, such as subsistence allowances for individual
7 legislators, which were capped at $5,000 per member. The focus was on requiring
8 "full and reasonable documentation" for these particular expenses to confirm they
9 served a public purpose.
10 This targeted oversight was not intended to extend to the entire budgets of
11 the Legislative or Judicial branches. Therefore, interpreting Article X, Section 8 as
12 granting the Department of Finance broad authority over the overall budgets of
13 these co-equal branches conflicts with the original intent of the amendment. Such
14 an expansive interpretation could undermine the Separation of Powers doctrine by
15 subordinating the Legislature and Judiciary to the Executive Branch.
16 Consequently, it is essential to interpret Article X, Section 8 within the context of
17 its original purpose—ensuring accountability for specific individual
18 expenditures—rather than as a mechanism for overarching control of the
19 Legislative and Judicial budgets. This understanding supports the establishment of
20 the Legislature Operations Fund and Judicial Operations Fund, to maintain the
21 financial independence of these branches.

Raw Text:
TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
First Regular Session, 2025 H. B. 24- fil
A BILL FOR AN ACT
To ensure that the expenditure authority designated in the
Annual Appropriation Act retains authority over all funds
appropriated to it.
11
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24T NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Findings. The Separation of Powers doctrine mandates that the
2 Commonwealth government consists of three co-equal and independent branches:
3 the Legislature, which enacts laws; the Executive, which enforces laws; and the
4 Judiciary, which interprets laws. To function effectively and prevent undue
5 influence, each branch must maintain fiscal autonomy and control over its
6 appropriated funds.
7 To uphold this principle, this Act establishes the Legislature Operations
8 Fund and Judicial Operations Fund, ensuring financial independence for both
9 branches. The CNMI Constitution explicitly mandates a system of government
10 composed of three co-equal and independent branches—Legislative, Executive,
11 and Judicial—each with distinct responsibilities and powers. Articles II, III, and IV
12 of the Constitution enshrine this principle, preventing any one branch from exerting

HOUSE BILL 24- 1
1 undue control over another.
2 The Judiciary already exercises a degree of fiscal autonomy, as it has been
3 delegated authority by the Secretary of Finance to oversee its appropriations and
4 manage its expenditures. However, the Legislature has not been granted such
5 authority, leaving it reliant on the Executive Branch for financial control over its
6 operations.
7 This disparity creates an imbalance that this Act seeks to correct by ensuring
8 that both the Judiciary and the Legislature have full control over their respective
9 budgets. These funds will be managed separately, with independent financial
10 records and bank accounts, and appropriations will be allotted quarterly to maintain
11 stability and predictability. By maintaining financial independence, each branch
12 can effectively fulfill its constitutional responsibilities without reliance on, or
13 interference from, another branch.
14 Furthermore, this Act guarantees a minimum appropriation of 9% of
15 available funds for the Legislature and 7% for the Judiciary. Each branch will have
16 full expenditure authority over its respective fund, aligning with established fiscal
17 practices of autonomous agencies. While the Legislative Bureau and Judiciary will
18 manage their funds, they will also adhere to general accounting principles and
19 submit financial reports to the Department of Finance for transparency, ensuring
20 responsible financial oversight without undermining autonomy.
21 To prevent executive overreach, this Act prohibits unilateral

HOUSE BILL 24-
1 impoundments, budget reductions, or reallocations that could compromise the
2 financial independence of the Judiciary and Legislature. Any changes to
3 appropriations, including reductions, must be enacted through legislative
4 amendments rather than executive actions, ensuring that fiscal decision-making
5 remains a shared responsibility among co-equal branches of government.
6 Background and Predecessor Legislation: House Bill 23-27
7 House Bill 23-27 was introduced on March 9, 2023, by Representative
8 Joseph A. Flores in response to growing concerns that the Executive Branch had
9 overstepped its constitutional boundaries by exerting excessive control over
10 legislative and judicial appropriations. Historically, the Executive Branch has
11 exercised broad discretion over budget allocations, including the ability to withhold
12 or reprogram funds appropriated to the Judiciary and Legislature. This practice
13 raised constitutional concerns, as it effectively placed financial decision-making
14 authority in the hands of the Executive, undermining the independence of the other
15 two branches.
16 To address this imbalance, House Bill 23-27 explicitly prohibited the
17 Executive Branch from impounding, reprogramming, or otherwise restricting funds
18 already appropriated to the Judiciary and Legislature. By doing so, it sought to
19 reinforce the principle that each branch of government must have direct and
20 unimpeded access to the resources necessary to fulfill its constitutional duties.
21 Building upon this foundation, this Act strengthens and codifies these
3
-

HOUSE BILL 24- /
1 protections to ensure that fiscal autonomy remains a permanent safeguard against
2 undue executive interference.
3 The Judiciary strongly supported HB 23-27, recognizing that financial
4 independence is essential to upholding its constitutional role and ensuring an
5 impartial and effective judicial system. In comments submitted by Chief Justice
6 Alexandro C. Castro and Presiding Judge Roberto C. Naraja, the Judiciary
7 emphasized:
8 "Under Article IV of the NMI Constitution, the Judiciary is unequivocally
9 acknowledged as a co-equal, independent branch of government. Sections 3, 4, 5,
10 and 6 of House Bill 23-27 recognize this independence, particularly as to the
11 Judiciary's fiscal authority. The ability to exercise independent fiscal decision-
12 making is a necessity to uphold the rule of law, maintain public confidence, and
13 prevent encroachment by another branch. For these reasons, the Judiciary fully
14 supports the passage of House Bill No. 23-27." (Judiciary Comments, April 13,
15 2023)
16 By codifying and strengthening these principles, this Act ensures that fiscal
17 autonomy remains protected as a cornerstone of government accountability and
18 separation of powers.
19 Rebuttal to the Attorney General's Opinion on HB 23-27
20 The CNMI Attorney General contended that HB 23-27 conflicts with
21 constitutional provisions related to budget ceilings and financial control under
4

HOUSE BILL 24- T,
1 Article X, Section 8. However, these claims misinterpret the intent of the
2 Constitution and the necessity of fiscal autonomy within a system of checks and
3 balances.
4 First, the claim that the legislative budget ceiling would be violated is
5 speculative. This Act does not automatically exceed the constitutional ceiling, as
6 any adjustments remain subject to the limitations of Article II, Section 16. The
7 Legislature retains the authority to amend budgetary frameworks within
8 constitutional constraints, making the concern unfounded.
9 Second, the assertion that Article X, Section 8 grants the Department of
10 Finance exclusive control over public funds is an overreach. The provision was
11 intended to ensure financial oversight, not to consolidate financial control under the
12 Executive Branch. If this interpretation were correct, existing statutory provisions
13 that grant expenditure authority to the Judiciary and Legislature would be
14 unconstitutional, which they are not.
15 The Second Constitutional Convention, which added Article X, Section 8,
16 aimed to promote financial accountability, not to subordinate the Judiciary and
17 Legislature to the Executive Branch. The Attorney General's interpretation
18 conflicts with statutory provisions that allow for separate branches to control their
19 budgets. Given its inconsistency with the Separation of Powers doctrine, it is clear
20 that the Attorney General Opinion does not directly contradict the intent of this bill.
21

2417
HOUSE BILL
1 Article X, Section 8 should be read and applied to better align with the
2 Constitution's foundational principles that allow for Legislative and Judicial
3 autonomy. The 1985 Second Constitutional Convention introduced Proposed
4 Amendment 31, which added Section 8 to Article X of the CNMI Constitution. The
5 primary intent of this amendment was to ensure financial accountability by
6 regulating specific expenditures, such as subsistence allowances for individual
7 legislators, which were capped at $5,000 per member. The focus was on requiring
8 "full and reasonable documentation" for these particular expenses to confirm they
9 served a public purpose.
10 This targeted oversight was not intended to extend to the entire budgets of
11 the Legislative or Judicial branches. Therefore, interpreting Article X, Section 8 as
12 granting the Department of Finance broad authority over the overall budgets of
13 these co-equal branches conflicts with the original intent of the amendment. Such
14 an expansive interpretation could undermine the Separation of Powers doctrine by
15 subordinating the Legislature and Judiciary to the Executive Branch.
16 Consequently, it is essential to interpret Article X, Section 8 within the context of
17 its original purpose—ensuring accountability for specific individual
18 expenditures—rather than as a mechanism for overarching control of the
19 Legislative and Judicial budgets. This understanding supports the establishment of
20 the Legislature Operations Fund and Judicial Operations Fund, to maintain the
21 financial independence of these branches.

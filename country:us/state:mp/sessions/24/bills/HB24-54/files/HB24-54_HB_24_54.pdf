TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
,r5(
Session, 2025 H. B. 24-
A BILL FOR AN ACT
To increase the number of military leave hours available to CNMI
government employees and to broaden eligibility for its use.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24TH NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Short Title. This Act may be cited as the "Military and
2 Emergency Service Leave Act of 2025."
3 Section 2. Findings and Purpose. The Legislature finds that the Uniformed
4 Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), 38 U.S.C. §§
5 4301 et seq., is a federal law that protects employees who serve in the nation's
6 uniformed services from job discrimination. In September 2022, the Civilian
7 Reservist Emergency Workforce (CREW) Act amended USERRA to explicitly
8 include Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Reservists as part of the
9 protected uniformed services.
10 In light of the CREW Act, the Legislature finds it necessary to update the
11 CNMI Government's military leave benefit to reflect the expanded categories of
12 federal uniformed service now recognized under USERRA. This Act modernizes
13 eligibility for the CNMI Government's paid military leave benefit by expressly

HOUSE BILL 24- Si4
1 including permanent CNMI Government employees who serve in the National
2 Guard, reserve components of the United States Armed Forces, the FEMA
3 Reservist Program, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
4 Commissioned Officer Corps, or any other uniformed service covered under
5 USERRA. By doing so, this Act ensures that all eligible CNMI Government
6 uniformed service employees ordered to perform active duty, training, emergency
7 response, or other authorized service under competent authority are extended this
8 employee benefit.
9 The Legislature also finds that multiple jurisdictions are expanding their
10 military leave benefits to better support citizen-soldiers as they balance increasingly
11 demanding service obligations with civilian employment. For example, in 2024,
12 Maryland enacted the Time to Serve Act, which authorized an increase in the
13 amount of leave state employees may take for military reserve duties from 15 to 30
14 days. Similarly, Section 1109 of the Fiscal Year 2025 National Defense
15 Authorization Act, Pub. L. No. 118-159, increased federal military leave benefits
16 from 15 to 20 days.
17 Like Maryland and the United States, the Legislature finds that increasing
18 the CNMI Government's military leave benefit from 15 to 30 days per calendar
19 year promotes the well-being and financial stability of goverment employees who
20 also fulfill military and federal emergency service duties. The Legislature also
21 acknowledges that this Act's expanded benefit strengthens the CNMI
2

HOUSE BILL 24-Sfk
1 Government's ability to recruit and retain uniformed service personnel by
2 enhancing the appeal and competitiveness of public sector employment for those
3 who serve.
4 Thus, by enacting this legislation, the CNMI affirms its commitment to
5 supporting citizen-soldiers and emergency responders who bear dual
6 responsibilities to their nation and their communities. The expanded eligibility and
7 increased duration of the paid leave benefit authorized by this Act ensures that the
8 CNMI Government remains a fair, supportive, and mission-ready employer in line
9 with the evolving expectations of federal law and national service.
10 Section 3. Enactment. Article 5 of Chapter 5, Part 2, Division 8, Title 1 of
11 the Commonwealth Code is hereby enacted to read as follows:
12 "Article 5. Military and Emergency Service Leave.
13 § 101. Military and Emergency Service Leave.

15 those in the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches, and any

18 leave not to exceed 30 working days per calendar year. This leave shall
19 be available to all permanent Commonwealth government employees

10 (2) are ordered to perform active duty, training, emergency response, or
11 other authorized service under competent military, federal, or state
12 authority, including service in response to a national emergency,
13 disaster, or other major incident.
14 (b) Military and emergency service leave shall be granted upon the
15 presentation of valid military orders or other appropriate
16 documentation.
17 (c) The maximum amount of paid leave authorized under this Section is 30
18 working days per calendar year. The 30-day cap shall not prevent an
19 employee from electing to use other accrued leave benefits for absences
20 in excess of the cap.

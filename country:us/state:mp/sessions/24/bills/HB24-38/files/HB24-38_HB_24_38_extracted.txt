Section 1:
TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
3g
Session, 2025 H. B. 24-
To establish a dedicated CNMI Emergency Reserve Fund
("Rainy Day Fund") with annual mandatory deposits and
procedures for fund disbursement in times of declared
emergency, while ensuring fiscal accountability.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24TH NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Short Title. This Act may be cited as the "Rainy Day Fund Act
2 of 2025."
3 Section 2. Findings and Purpose. Securing long-term fiscal stability while
4 responding to short-term crises is a recurring challenge for the Commonwealth. The
5 Legislature finds that repeated natural disasters and economic shocks—including
6 Super Typhoons Soudelor, Mangkhut, and Yutu, followed by the COVID-19
7 pandemic—have exposed the limitations of reactive budgeting. In each instance,
8 the absence of a pre-committed emergency reserve delayed the government's
9 response and placed undue strain on general operations. This Act corrects that
10 structural vulnerability by establishing a statutory Rainy Day Fund with annual
11 deposits of $1,000,000 or one percent of General Revenues, whichever is greater,
12 beginning in Fiscal Year 2026.
31
HOUSE BILL 24-
1 Acknowledging existing statutory measures, the Legislature affirms that
2 this Act supplements—not repeals—Public Law 20-82, codified at 4 CMC § 2308,
3 which established a Commonwealth Reserves Fund. While that law shares the same
4 general policy aim, it lacks an enforceable deposit mechanism, disbursement
5 controls, and protections against fund lapse. This law was also enacted during a
6 period of anticipated gaming revenues that have proven to be inconsistent.
7 Likewise, the contingency-based funding authority for mayors under 1 CMC §
8 5109 supports local flexibility but does not provide a centralized fiscal buffer for
9 Commonwealth-wide emergencies. This Act, however, enhances both efforts by
10 creating a durable, centralized reserve structure with automatic deposits and defined
11 access protocols.
12 Valid emergency declarations by the Governor shall serve as the sole basis
13 for initiating fund disbursement. The Governor's role in identifying emergencies is
14 constitutionally grounded; however, fund release remains subject to a joint
15 resolution of the Legislature. To preserve emergency responsiveness while
16 ensuring oversight, the joint resolution process under this Act operates outside of
17 budget legislation and is exempt from veto or override. This preserves clear lines
18 of accountability between the branches without inviting judicial second-guessing
19 of political judgment calls during times of crisis.

31
HOUSE BILL 24-
1 Ensuring transparency and trust in the use of these funds, the Secretary of
2 Finance is required to submit a detailed report to the Legislature no later than 180
3 days after the end of an emergency declaration—or 60 days before the end of the
4 fiscal year, whichever comes first. This report must account for each disbursement
5 and include recommendations for future policy improvements. The Fund is hereby
6 designated as non-lapsing, shall remain segregated from the General Fund, and is
7 classified as a Special Revenue Fund not subject to the education set-aside under
8 Article XV, Section 1(e) of the CNMI Constitution.
9 Strengthening the Commonwealth's emergency posture without
10 undermining existing frameworks, this Act creates an enduring reserve mechanism
11 that aligns with best practices in fiscal governance. It prioritizes readiness over
12 reaction without displacing localized or prior statutory tools and establishes a
13 permanent fiscal safeguard aligned with best practices in public finance. By
14 separating emergency savings from political budgeting cycles and reinforcing—but
15 not supplanting—existing statutory tools, including 1 CMC § 5109 and 4 CMC §
16 2308, the Commonwealth SAVES: it Secures stability, Acknowledges gaps,
17 Validates separation of powers, Ensures accountability, and Strengthens resilience.
18 Section 3. Enactment: Subject to codification by the CNMI Law Revision
19 Commission, there is hereby enacted a new Chapter under Title 1, Division 7 of the
20 Commonwealth Code to read as follows:

6 (b) Within 30 days of the effective date of the Commonwealth
7 annual budget appropriation, the Secretary of Finance shall

10 whichever is greater, annually into the Fund, beginning Fiscal
11 Year 2026.
12 (c) Said revenues in the Fund shall not be subject to allocation under
13 Article XV, Section 1(e) of the Commonwealth Constitution.
14 (d) The Fund shall not lapse at the end of a fiscal year and shall not

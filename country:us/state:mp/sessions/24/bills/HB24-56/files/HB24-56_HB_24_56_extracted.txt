Section 1:
TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
414
Regular Session, 2025 H. B. 24-
To establish the CNMI Air Service Development Matching
Fund to support federal air service development grants, such as
the Small Community Air Service Development Program, and
to provide procedures and responsibilities related to the use of
the Fund.
11
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24T NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Short Title. This Act may be cited as the "Air Service
2 Development Matching Fund Act of 2025."
3 Section 2. Findings and Purpose. The Legislature finds that the
4 Commonwealth's geographic isolation and limited commercial air service create
5 significant barriers to economic recovery, tourism development, and public access
6 to essential services.
7 The Legislature also finds that the U.S. Department of Transportation
8 administers the Small Community Air Service Development Program (SCASDP)
9 under 49 U.S.C. § 41743 to help small communities improve their air service
10 through flexible, community-designed projects that may include route subsidies,
11 tourism marketing, and air service feasibility studies.
HOUSE BILL 24- 4.4
1 In Fiscal Year 2021, the Commonwealth Ports Authority (CPA) submitted
2 a SCASDP application that sought $1.9 million in funding. The application was not
3 selected for award, primarily due to the absence of a clearly defined public-private
4 partnership, the lack of a proposed non-airport local cost match, and the size of the
5 funding request. The U.S. Department of Transportation advised CPA to
6 collaborate more closely with local agencies and obtain letters of support from both
7 public and private stakeholders to enhance the competitiveness of its future
8 applications.
9 The Legislature also recognizes that federal air service development grant
10 awards can be used to support broader public interests. For example, improvements
11 to air service can promote access to healthcare and education and attract tourists
12 from key markets. Additionally, federal air service development grant funds can
13 also typically be used to assist with community-specific studies and other locally
14 relevant initiatives that enhance the overall quality of life and economic resilience
15 of the Commonwealth.
16 Thus, the purpose of this Act is to establish the CNMI Air Service
17 Development Matching Fund, to provide a credible and organized mechanism for
18 supporting federal air service development applications, and to ensure that the
19 CNMI is prepared to submit competitive proposals that reflect community needs,
20 demonstrate meaningful public-private cooperation, and align with federal
21 priorities.

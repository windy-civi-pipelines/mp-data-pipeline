action to identify, remove, and safely dispose of World War II-era
unexploded ordnance throughout the Northern Mariana Islands.
1 WHEREAS, during World War II, the United States military conducted
2 extensive operations in the Northern Mariana Islands, which left behind
3 unexploded ordnance (UXO) and other discarded munitions; and
4 WHEREAS, many of those munitions remain buried, scattered, or
5 submerged, and are still found in residential areas, construction zones, beaches, and
6 public lands, often without warning or documentation of their presence; and
7 WHEREAS, historical estimates from the United States Department of
8 Defense and the United States Navy indicate that as much as 25 percent of the
9 ordnance used during the war failed to detonate as intended, reflecting both the
10 scale of contamination and the likelihood that undiscovered hazards remain
11 throughout the islands; and
HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION
1 WHEREAS, the continuing danger of UXO is evidenced by its discovery
2 during the 2019 recovery operation at American Memorial Park after Tropical
3 Storm Krosa and during community cleanups following Super Typhoon Yutu; and
4 WHEREAS, currently, the Department of Defense responds to the
5 presence of UXO in the Northern Mariana Islands primarily through emergency
6 response protocols, deploying explosive ordnance disposal teams to address
7 hazards when they are discovered or reported; and
8 WHEREAS, while such responses may neutralize immediate threats, they
9 do not extend to comprehensive site investigations, hazard assessments, or long-
10 term cleanup planning, leaving the broader problem unremedied; and
11 WHEREAS, the current approach shifts the costs and risks of legacy
12 ordnance from the federal government to the Government of the Commonwealth
13 of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), which, under its current Memorandum of
14 Understanding with Joint Region Marianas, is required to cover lodging, travel, and
15 logistical support for federal explosive ordnance disposal teams; and
16 WHEREAS, imposing such costs on the CNMI is both unsustainable and
17 inequitable, especially when consideration is given to the fact that, under the
18 Formerly Used Defense Sites (FUDS) program, the federal government funds the
19 remediation of similar hazards for the individual States;

FOR THE THIRD SENATORIAL DISTRICT

BE IT ENACTED BY THE THIRD SENATORIAL DISTRICT
DELEGATION PURSUANT TO CHAPTER 4, DIVISION 1, TITLE 1 OF
THE COMMONWEALTH CODE:
1 SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
2 Devoted to public service for decades, the Honorable Diego Tenorio
3 Benavente began his career in the CNMI House of Representatives, first
4 representing Precinct II before later serving Precinct I on Saipan. Elected in 1989,
5 he served six consecutive terms through 2000, demonstrating principled leadership
6 and earning the respect of colleagues and constituents alike. As Speaker during the
7 9th, 10th, and 1 I th Legislatures, he guided the passage of critical measures that
8 strengthened the Commonwealth's economy, infrastructure, and educational
9 systems, leaving a legacy of legislative achievement that continues to benefit the
10 community.
HOUSE LOCAL BILL 24-22
1 Influential in advancing the CNMI' s standing throughout the Pacific region,
2 he has worked to strengthen ties between island governments and promote
3 cooperative development. In addition to his service in the Legislature, he also
4 served one term as Lieutenant Governor, where his leadership extended to the
5 executive branch and reinforced his reputation for integrity and dedication. Today,
6 he continues to serve the region as a member of the Board of Directors of the Pacific
7 Islands Development Bank and, since 2018, as the Honorary Consul of the
8 Federated States of Micronesia to the CNMI, roles through which he champions
9 the growth and prosperity of island communities.
10 Exceptional in his accomplishments beyond the halls of government, he is
11 an avid fisherman who has earned victories in several fishing derby categories,
12 including twice being named Grand Champion of the annual Saipan International
13 Fishing Tournament. His life-long membership in the Saipan Fishermen's
14 Association reflects his deep connection to the maritime traditions of the
15 Commonwealth and his commitment to preserving them for future generations.
16 Through both competition and advocacy, he has helped foster pride in the CNMI' s
17 fishing heritage and inspired others to carry it forward.
18 Generous with his time, wisdom, and compassion, he has been a source of
19 guidance and support for countless individuals across the Commonwealth. As a
20 devoted husband, loving father, proud grandfather, supportive brother, and caring
21 uncle, he is admired not only for his public service but for the humility and kindness

1 that define his character. These personal qualities have made him as beloved in
2 private life as he is respected in public life, creating a legacy built on both
3 achievement and service to humanity.
4 Owing to the Benavente family's long-standing presence in the As Lito
5 area, and given that a major segment of Lana Drive leads directly to several of the
6 Benavente family homes, including Diego T. Benavente's personal residence, it is
7 only fitting that this relevant portion of the road bears his name. This designation
8 will serve as a lasting tribute to his leadership, his contributions to the
9 Commonwealth, and the example he has set for future generations. By renaming a
10 portion of Lana Drive in the village of As Lito, Precinct I, as the "Diego T.
11 Benavente Drive," the Delegation affirms its recognition of a lifetime dedicated to
12 service, community, and the enduring values that bind the Commonwealth together.
13 SECTION 2. STREET RENAMING.
14 The public roadway presently known as Lana Drive, located in the village
15 of As Lito, Precinct I, connecting to Chalan Monsignor Martinez (Route 37)
16 (between Tanu Ln and Daddek Ln) is hereby renamed the "Diego T. Benavente
17 Drive" in honor of the Honorable Diego Tenorio Benavente, former Lieutenant
18 Governor, Speaker of the House, and long-serving public servant of the
19 Commonwealth. Provided further, all other segments of Lana Drive including the
20 segment that connects to Soow Lane and As Lito Drive shall remain the same.

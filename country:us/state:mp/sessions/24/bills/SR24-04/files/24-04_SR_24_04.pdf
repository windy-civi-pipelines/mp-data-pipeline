1 WHEREAS, Taiwan has been a responsible member of the international
2 community and plays a vital stabilizing role in the Indo-Pacific region and has
3 demonstrated leadership through its participation in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework
4 (IPEF), contributing to the prosperity and security of the United States and its allies; and
5 WHEREAS, Taiwan has been unjustly excluded from the World Health Assembly
6 (WHA) due to political pressure from the Peoples Republic of China (PRC), despite its
7 world-class public health system, significant contributions to global health particularly
8 evident during the COVID-19 pandemic; and the urgent need for inclusive global health
9 cooperation, as emphasized by leaders like President Lai Ching-te; and
10 WHEREAS, the World Health Organization's (WHO) Constitution affirms the
11 universal right to highest attainable standard of health as a fundamental right without
12 discrimination, and because national boundaries do not confine health challenges, Taiwan's
13 participation as an observer in the WHO is vital for the mutual benefit of the international
14 community through global efforts, shared expertise in epidemic control, disease
15 prevention, defense against biosecurity, and health policy discussions; and
16 WHEREAS, Taiwan’s inclusion in INTERPOL, ICAO, and UNFCC would
17 contribute positively to global law enforcement and aviation safety efforts by ensuring a
18 timely and meaningful exchange of data and coordination; and
19 WHEREAS, the United States must support Taiwan’s meaningful participation in
20 the World Health Assembly (WHA), the International Police Criminal Organization
21 (INTERPOL), the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and the United
22 Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC); and
23 WHEREAS, Taiwan’s inclusion in international organizations is crucial for
24 positively addressing global challenges in effectively upholding the highest standards to
25 global health, safety, security, and environmental sustainability and a strong commitment
26 to climate action and should be afforded participation in the United Nations Framework
27 Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to contribute its expertise and engage in
28 collective environmental efforts;

The Honorable Edmund S. Villagomez
Speaker, House of Representatives
24th Northern Marianas Commonwealth Legislature
Saipan, MP 96950
The Honorable Karl R. King-Nabors
Senate President
24th Northern Marianas Commonwealth Legislature
Saipan, MP 96950
Dear Mr. Speaker and Mr. President:
This is to inform the Legislature that I have signed into law House Bill 24-46, HD1, SS1
(Appropriations and Budget Authority Act of 2026 or the Act). While I support the overall
objectives of the Act, I have exercised my authority to disapprove of several specific provisions
contained therein.
These disapproved sections are deemed inconsistent and problematic in implementation with
the fiscal priorities and policy goals necessary to ensure responsible governance when our
economic climate has shifted. Implementing these provisions would undermine our
commitment to prudent financial stewardship and long-term stability. A detailed explanation
of the disapproved items is included in my message for legislative review and public
transparency.
Although I commend the Legislature for passing the Act, I am compelled to express our mutual
understanding that an immediate revised budget is necessary to address my communication
concerning the change in revenue projection and the continued funding shortfall for critical
programs and services, such as:
• Marianas Visitors Authority
,LE S
• DOF ERP (Munis) A in?),5yrci
• Group Health and Life Insurance Program (Retirees)
• Medical Referral (Health Network Program) DMA TI 14E 9.1'3-241-
• Medicaid
• Department of Corrections (Inmate Medical Care and Meals)
• Government Utilities and Operations
• 25% Benefit Payments to Retirees

Caller Box 10007 • Saipan, MP 96950 • (670) 237-2200- governor.gov.mp

In addition to the foregoing concerns, I have line-item vetoed several parts of the Act which I
have found unclear, ambiguous, or problematic either in their inconsistency with existing
provisions of Commonwealth or Federal law, or in their implementation or imposition of
additional and unnecessary steps that would hinder efficiency in government operations.
My comments and actions are as follows:
COMMENTS ON APPROVED PARTS OF THE ACT
Section 403. Donation of Sick Leave Hours.
There may be a disparity in pay rates between the donor and the recipient of donated sick leave
hours. The provision allows donated sick leave at a value of 1.0; this may require additional
donated sick leave hours when the recipient's rate is greater than the donor's, increasing the
government's fiscal obligations. I urge the Civil Service Commission to amend the regulations
to address this issue.
Section 501. Reprogramming Authority.
Section 501(c) grants 25% reprogramming authority to the mayors of each Senatorial District.
I observe that this authority should be wielded over local funds to ensure efficiency in local
government, rather than with respect to executive branch offices.
Section 601. Utilities.
A directive from my administration is forthcoming to address cost-containment measures
regarding the mandatory transition of all executive branch accounts to prepaid meters within 30
days to further reduce the cost of utilities. This will ensure energy conservation practices are
utilized.
Section 605. Legal Holidays
In implementing this provision, care should be taken to avoid conflict with the federal Fair
Labor Standards Act (FLSA).
Section 614. MVA Trust Funds.
This section requires the Secretary of Finance to allocate a minimum of $43,750 per quarter to
the municipalities, and no less than $175,000 before the end of the fiscal year. This provision
may result in less direct funding to the Marianas Visitors Authority to mitigate impacts of
declining tourist arrivals should the actual collection of the Hotel Occupancy Tax be less than
the required transfer as provided. Any shortage of collections would divert funds from MVA to
the municipalities.
Section 616. Payment of 25% to Retirees.
The payment to the Commonwealth Treasury of $5 million from the IPI bankruptcy sale
included $2.7 million in casino gross revenue tax, which is earmarked for the payment of the
25% retirees' pension by 4 CMC §§ 2308 and 2309. My administration supports this earmark
and I look forward to working with the legislature on reforms to the Casino Gaming law to
promote a viable industry and generate revenue.

Caller Box 10007 • Saipan, MP 96950 • (670) 237-2200 • governor.gov.mp

Section 709. Other Programs.
Section 709(c) provides for 96% of funding to the Public School System to be directed towards
instructional expenditures and restrictions on austerity measures. My administration encourages
further dialogue with PSS to ensure that legislative provisions are aligned with students' needs
and operational necessities.
Section 711. Department of Public Lands.
The Memorandum of Understanding to be executed by the Department of Public Lands, the
Department of Lands & Natural Resources, and the mayors of the municipalities should ensure
a nexus to the constitutional responsibilities of DPL in maintaining and securing public lands
and properties.
I observe that the mandate for DPL to remit $4,000,000 from its DPL Operations Fund to the
Marianas Public Land Trust is consistent with, but not coextensive with or exhaustive of, its
obligations under Article XI, Section 5(g) of the Constitution.
VETOED PARTS OF THE ACT
Section 202. Advance Allotment.
I am disapproving the provision as the recent downward adjustment to estimated revenues
makes it difficult to justify the quarterly allocation of funding at this time. This provision can
be revisited in the revised FY 2026 budget.
Section 204. Reporting Requirements for Secretary of Finance.
Section 204(d) is duplicative of reporting requirements in the Planning and Budgeting Act. I
am vetoing Section 204(e), as it presents a constitutional separation of powers issue by
stipulating adverse personnel actions for an Executive Branch officer.
Section 501. Reprogramming Authority.
I acknowledge that the Governor has been granted authority to reprogram up to 25% of
appropriations for the Executive Branch. While this provision offers a measure of flexibility, I
am disapproving Section 501(a) as it mirrors the authority conferred by statute through 1 CMC
§ 7402(b). Instead, I urge legislative consideration to increase flexibility in reprogramming
authority to 100% to ensure the Governor can take swift and decisive executive action when
needed.
Section 602. Hiring Restriction.
I have disapproved Section 602(a) because it violates the separation of powers for the
Legislature to determine via joint resolution, on a case-by-case basis, whether budgeted
executive branch positions are essential for delivery of public services. Implementation of this
provision will be problematic as it restricts the Executive Branch's ability to respond to
operational needs.
I have also disapproved Section 602(b), because it is unenforceable for a Notice of Personnel
Action to be deemed processed and filled in without adequate funding or authorized positions.

Caller Box 10007 • Saipan, MP 96950 • (670) 237-2200 • governor.gov.mp

Section 603. Salary Cap.
Section 603(a) is hereby disapproved as compensation for appointed officials is already
stipulated under 1 CMC § 8425 and unnecessary in this measure.
Section 607. Reduction of Work Hours.
I have disapproved this section because it may be necessary for forthcoming austerity measures
to implement cuts to ancillary benefits proportionally with cuts to hours. My administration
urges the Civil Service Commission to revise existing regulations to support prudent fiscal
policy during periods of austerity. Specifically, when reductions in hours are implemented,
corresponding benefits such as sick leave and annual leave should be adjusted in proportion to
the reduced hours per pay period. This alignment will help realize meaningful cost savings.
Further, I recommend that the annual leave accrual policy be amended to mirror the federal
government's "use-it-or-lose-it" approach, whereby unused leave expires at the end of the
calendar year. Such a change would significantly reduce the government's growing unfunded
liability associated with accumulated leave balances.
These measures are necessary to safeguard the financial health of the Commonwealth while
maintaining fairness and transparency in public service employment practices.
Section 608. Vacant Positions.
I have disapproved this section as it provides that any position that becomes vacant shall be
closed out. Implementation of this provision places an inflexible constraint on the Executive
Branch's ability to respond to operational needs.
Section 609. Public Auditor's Fee.
I have disapproved this provision because the resources of the Office of the Public Auditor are
needed to coordinate the efforts of the CNMI government to catch up on several years of
delayed single audits on an expedited timeline.
Under these circumstances, it is inappropriate to divert OPA's resources to the Group Health
Life Insurance Program. Direct funding appropriation is necessary and should be prioritized in
the revised budget for FY 2026.
Section 610. BPS Rota and BPS Tinian Detainees.
I have disapproved this provision because it is inappropriate for the Department of Corrections
to shoulder the burden of costs incurred by the Department of Public Safety in its operations.
The Department of Corrections will assume costs upon transfer of custody.
Section 611. OGM Funds in Excess of Office of Grants Management Budget.
Allocating excess funds earmarked to the Office of Grants Management to the Group Health
and Life Insurance Program is inappropriate to sustain adequate funding and operation of the
program as required payments must be made timely to avoid termination of the plan. Direct
funding appropriation is necessary and should be prioritized in the revised budget for FY 2026.

Caller Box 10007 • Saipan, MP 96950 • (670) 237-2200 • governor.gov.mp

Section 612. Hazardous Pay.
A portion of this section is disapproved to allow the Secretary of Public Works to process
hazardous pay based on funding availability and ensure that payment requests meet necessary
requirements.
Section 615. Commonwealth Casino Members.
I have disapproved of this provision because the Commonwealth's scarce resources must
prioritize the most vulnerable in our community, including students and retirees, in these trying
fiscal times.
Moreover, the provision references a $2.7 million Settlement Agreement with Imperial Pacific
International (IPI). This appears to refer to the sale of IPI's assets to Team King Investment
(CNMI), LLC, via auction supervised by the federal bankruptcy court. That portion of the
proceeds which satisfies the Commonwealth's tax lien for unpaid Casino Business Gross
Revenue Tax is earmarked to the retirees' 25% pension benefits and cannot be used to pay the
Casino Commissioners' backpay.
The Casino Commission is funded by law through regulatory fees paid by the exclusive casino
licensee. The Commissioners' salaries may be paid through the pro rata distribution to general
unsecured creditors of remaining assets in IPI' s bankruptcy, as provided in the stipulation
resolving the Commonwealth's objection to the sale to Team King.
Schedule B is hereby disapproved as a direct consequence of the veto to Section 615.
Section 617. Outside Source Received by the CNMI.
This provision purported to mandate that "[a]ny funds received by the CNMI government from
the federal government or other outside sources shall be identified by the Governor and reported
to the Legislature for appropriation."
This provision would violate federal law, as federal grants to instrumentalities of the CNMI
government must be used for the cost objectives stipulated in the terms of the grants.
Section 703(d). Judicial Branch.
I have disapproved this provision because the Judicial Branch, like the rest of the CNMI
government, may be subject to proportional cuts as provided by the Planning and Budgeting
Act, 1 CMC § 7204(e).
Section 704(i). Legislative Branch.
I have disapproved this provision because the Legislative Branch, like the rest of the CNMI
government, may be subject to proportional cuts as provided by the Planning and Budgeting
Act, 1 CMC § 7204(e).

Caller Box 10007 • Saipan, MP 96950 • (670) 237-2200 • governor.gov.mp

Section 705. Executive Branch.
I have disapproved Section 705(c) because mandating that law enforcement officers' overtime
be funded from non-general revenue imposes a rigid and inflexible approach and risks moral
hazard incentive problems.
Section 705(e) provides that the Department of Community and Cultural Affairs, alone among
CNMI executive agencies, is to retain indirect costs of federal grants which would otherwise
be statutorily earmarked to the Office of Grants Management. There is no sound reason to treat
DCCA differently from all other agencies in this respect. My administration will direct federally
funded programs to fund utilities and operations through savings realized from transitioning to
the lower indirect cost rate of 7.5%.
Finally, I have disapproved Section 705(g) because this provision unduly restricts the discretion
of the Department of Labor to allocate its resources to workforce training programs as
appropriate. I urge the Secretary of Labor to include the municipalities' apprenticeship and
training needs in the proposed expenditure plan for the Commonwealth Worker Fee Fund.
Section 706. First Senatorial District- Mayor of Rota and Rota Municipal Council.
The last sentence of Section 706(b) is line-item-vetoed on the same grounds as Section
705(c).
Section 707. Second Senatorial District- Mayor of Tinian & Aguiguan and Tinian
Municipal Council.
The last sentence of Section 707(b) is line-item-vetoed on the same grounds as Section 705(c)
and the equivalent portion of Section 706(b).
Section 707(d) is disapproved because it is the purview of the Tinian and Aguiguan
Legislative Delegation through a local appropriations bill, not the Legislature in the annual
appropriation bill, to amend local appropriation bills. My administration supports funding of
personnel with the approval of the respective senatorial delegation.
Section 708. Third Senatorial District- Mayor of Saipan; Mayor of the Northern Islands;
and Saipan and Northern Islands Municipal Council.
Section 708(b) is disapproved because authorizing the Mayor of the Northern Islands to
promulgate regulations to generate revenues from fees is an appropriate subject for SNILD
legislation, not the annual appropriations bill.
Section 709. Other Programs.
I have disapproved the requirement in subsection (e) that the CNMI Health Network Program,
formerly known as the Medical Referral Program, shall include stipends, airfare, and lodging
for patients and escorts in the inter-island medical referral services. The appropriation for the
Health Network Program is insufficient to cover such costs. This is an unfunded mandate.
Section 711. Department of Public Lands.
I have disapproved a portion of Section 711(a) because ground maintenance and landscaping
work under the jurisdiction of Parks and Recreation is a statutory responsibility of the
Department of Lands and Natural Resources.

Caller Box 10007 • Saipan, MP 96950 • (670) 237-2200 • governor.gov.mp

Section 712. Reporting Requirements.
I am disapproving Section 712's provisions because they are duplicative of the reporting
requirements set forth in Section 204 and create additional and unreasonable administrative
burdens that will be difficult to implement.
I am directing the Secretary of Finance to continue working with the Legislature to assist it in
performing its own analysis of the government's finances.
Section 713. Violation of Spending Limits.
I have disapproved the additional penalties and sanctions in Section 713. The Planning and
Budgeting Act (PBA), as amended, has adequate enforcement provisions to assure compliance
with the expenditure restrictions under the PBA and this Act.
In particular, 1 CMC §§ 7701 and 7702 provide criminal penalties for expenditures in excess
of authorization by law.
Section 802. Outside Sources.
I have disapproved parts of Subsection (b) because of inconsistency between the language and
U.S. Public Law 115-218, which governs the use and administration of the CW funds. The
federal law does not limit training programs to only those for vocational training. The federal
law also provides restrictions on the administration of the funds, including reprogramming and
fiscal year limitation.
Schedule A.
While I recognize the importance of soil and water conservation efforts across the
Commonwealth, I must disapprove the establishment and funding allocation for the CNMI State
and Water Conservation Office included under the Independent Program heading.
The Act does not contain any express provision clarifying the intent behind its inclusion.
Moreover, the program is already embedded within all three senatorial districts, and the creation
of a centralized office would be duplicative and administratively redundant.
I remain committed to supporting conservation initiatives through existing district-level
programs and encourage continued collaboration to ensure resources are used efficiently and
effectively.
Conclusion
As we implement the budget appropriation in this Act, I remind the Legislature of the urgency
to pass a revised budget with decreased revenues forecasted at $156,782,740. In light of this
forecasted decline, my administration will implement immediate proportionate budget
reductions across the board resulting in a forthcoming work hour cut to the executive branch
beginning Sunday, October 5, 2025 (pay period 22). Therefore, I urge your cooperation to pass
a revision of the FY 2026 Budget Act within ten calendar days from transmittal of the request,
targeted for October 6, 2025.

Marianas Public Land Trust for a pension loan.
With my signature, this bill becomes Public Law No. 24-14. Copies of the public law bearing
my signature are forwarded for your reference.

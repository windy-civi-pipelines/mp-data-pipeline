TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Session, 2025 H. B. 24-(9f
A BILL FOR AN ACT
To enact a new Chapter 5 to Title 1, Division 8, Part 1 of the
Commonwealth Code to establish dedicated funding and a
special account for the Civil Service Commission; to provide a
pro rata collection, certification, and transfer mechanism of
funds; to authorize a continuing appropriation and expenditure
authority; and to require reporting and legislative oversight.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24TH NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Findings and Purpose. The Legislature finds that recurring
2 funding instability has prevented the Civil Service Commission ("Commission")
3 from timely adjudicating appeals and grievances, obtaining needed legal guidance,
4 and delivering mandatory trainings across Saipan, Tinian, and Rota—causing
5 delays, halted services, and diminished public confidence. The Legislature further
6 finds that predictable funding is necessary to preserve the Commission's
7 independence, avoid post-enactment reprogramming disputes, and ensure equitable
8 access to training, with particular attention to addressing disparities affecting
9 personnel on Tinian and Rota.
10 It is therefore the purpose of this Act to establish a funding mechanism that
11 provides the Commission a stable minimum amount of funding, collects funds by

HOUSE BILL 24-4, /
1 operation of law, and subjects all spending to ordinary fiscal controls, audit, and
2 oversight.
3 To that end, this Act creates a dedicated annual appropriation to the
4 Commission equal to the greater of 0.5 percent of the Defined Base or $450,000,
5 capped at 1.0 percent of the Defined Base, with the Defined Base consisting only
6 of General Fund Operations appropriations for the Executive, Legislative, and
7 Judicial Branches—i.e., non-personnel, non-utilities operating lines as shown in the
8 annual appropriations act's Operations schedules or any functionally equivalent
9 schedule—and expressly excluding federal or grant monies; special, revolving,
10 dedicated, trust, or custodial funds; capital improvement projects; debt service and
11 settlement/judgment obligations; any General Fund transfers, pass-throughs,
12 subsidies, or subventions to autonomous agencies or public corporations; and prior-
13 year reappropriations and any non-lapsing funds. The dedicated annual
14 appropriation to the Commission is collected pro rata by operation of law on the
15 first day of the fiscal year from all Covered Lines in proportion to each line's share
16 of the Defined Base. Within 15 business days after the annual appropriations act
17 becomes law, the Secretary of Finance must calculate and publish a ministerial
18 proration table identifying the Defined Base, each Covered Line's enacted amount,
19 percentage share, reduction, and net amount, without altering coverage,
20 percentages, timing, or sources. Within 15 business days of publication, each
21 branch certifies its net Covered Line amounts; if a branch does not certify, the
-2

HOUSE BILL 24- 4p i
1 published table governs its internal distribution by operation of law. Transfers to
2 the Commission's special account occur on October 15, January 15, April 15, and
3 July 15, with the Secretary of Finance transferring the Executive Branch share and
4 the presiding officers or authorized fiscal officers directing the Legislative and
5 Judicial shares strictly in accordance with the published pro rata amounts.
6 This Act further establishes a special, non-lapsing Commission account in the
7 Commonwealth Treasury with a continuing appropriation, designates the
8 Commission Chair as expenditure authority, and subjects all expenditures to Article
9 X, Section 8 of the Commonwealth Constitution and to all applicable fiscal,
10 procurement, and audit laws and regulations. No diversion of funds for non-
11 Commission purposes is authorized. Permitted uses include contracting an
12 independent administrative hearing officer; retaining independent legal counsel for
13 particular matters when the Office of the Attorney General identifies a conflict of
14 interest or lacks available resources, or when independent tribunal counsel is
15 required in a pending adjudication, subject to the limitation that in any matter in
16 which the Office of the Attorney General represents an employing agency before
17 the Commission, neither that attorney nor any attorney under that attorney's
18 supervision may advise the Commission or the hearing officer on the merits of that
19 matter; funding mandatory and continual training for government employees on
20 Saipan, Tinian, and Rota, including necessary inter-island travel and venue costs;
21 paying Commission utilities, including electricity, water, wastewater, solid waste,
3

HOUSE BILL 24-61
1 telecommunications, and interne; and other personnel and operational needs
2 necessary for the Commission's full and effective function, including necessary
3 inter-island travel and venue costs.
4 To ensure transparency and accountability, the Commission must submit an
5 annual financial and performance report within 90 days after each fiscal year and
6 is subject to audit by the Office of the Public Auditor and the Department of
7 Finance. Additionally, the Legislature shall conduct a triennial review to assess the
8 effectiveness of this Act and to consider modifications. Nondiscretionary duties
9 established by this Act, including publication of the proration table, branch
10 certification, and scheduled transfers, may be enforced by mandamus or declaratory
11 relief to compel compliance.
12 Thus, this Act establishes a stable, nonpartisan funding stream for the Civil
13 Service Commission. Funding is set by law through a pro rata reduction limited to
14 the General Fund and implemented by ministerial calculation, branch certification,
15 and quarterly transfers. Restricted and other non—General Fund monies are
16 excluded. All expenditures remain subject to ordinary fiscal, procurement, and
17 audit controls, with transparent reporting and periodic legislative review. Together,
18 these measures provide stable, transparent support so the Commission can execute
19 its statutory mandate and sustain public confidence in a merit-based civil service.
20 Section 2. Enactment. To enact a new Chapter 5 to Title 1, Division 8, Part
-4

HOUSE BILL 24- (1
1 1 of the Commonwealth Code to read as follows:
2 "Chapter 5. Dedicated Funding and Special Account for the Civil
3 Service Commission.
4 § 101. Dedicated Funding; Pro Rata Collection, Certification, and
5 Transfer.
6 (a) As used in this Section:
7 (1) "Business day" means a day other than Saturday, Sunday, or a legal
8 public holiday in the Commonwealth.
9 (2) "Commission" means the Civil Service Commission.
10 (3) "Covered Lines" means General Fund Operations appropriations
11 enacted in the annual appropriations act for the Executive Branch, the
12 Legislative Branch, and the Judicial Branch, as shown in the act's
13 Operations schedules or any other functionally equivalent schedule,
14 however captioned, that itemizes non-personnel, non-utilities
15 operating appropriations, and expressly excluding:
16 (i) federal or grant funds and any special, revolving, dedicated, trust,
17 or custodial funds;
18 (ii) capital improvement projects;
19 (iii) debt service and settlement/judgment obligations;
5

HOUSE BILL 24- 4/ I
1 (iv) any General Fund appropriation whose stated purpose is a
2 transfer, pass-through, subsidy, or other general support payment
3 to an autonomous agency or public corporation; and
4 (v) prior-year reappropriations and any non-lapsing funds.
5 (4) "Defined Base" means the sum of all Covered Lines for the fiscal year
6 as enacted.

11 the Defined Base.
12 (c) On the first day of each fiscal year, every Covered Line is automatically
13 reduced by its proportionate share of the CSC Amount. A line's
14 proportionate share is the same fraction that its enacted amount bears to
15 the Defined Base, and the total of all such reductions must equal the CSC
16 Amount. After this reduction, only the net amounts may be allotted,
17 encumbered, or expended. If the floor in subsection (b) exceeds 0.5% of
18 the Defined Base, the effective reduction rate shall equal the CSC Amount
19 divided by the Defined Base, and the proration table shall display that rate.
20 In no event shall the effective reduction rate exceed 1.0%.

9 appropriations act and does not adjust for any supplemental or deficiency
10 appropriation enacted thereafter; provided, however, that if a later
11 supplemental or deficiency appropriation changes the total of Covered

13 amended proration table that applies only to the remaining unpaid
14 quarterly transfers. No recalculation shall occur after publication of the

16 the one-time amended table described in the preceding sentence; any such
17 correction or amendment must be published and applied prospectively.

TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE
SECOND SPECIAL SESSION, 2025 S. B. NO. 24-34
A BILL FOR AN ACT
To restructure the electricity market in the CNMI by deregulating
electric services; and for other purposes.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Findings and Purpose. The Legislature finds that 32 states and
2 Washington DC have introduced some form of energy deregulation and retail energy
3 choice as of 2025. Depending on the state this applies for electricity, natural gas or both
4 utility services nearly half of US states have introduced some degree of energy
5 deregulation and retail energy choice to homes and businesses within their borders.
6 In a regulated electricity market, a single utility company controls the entire
7 process of electricity generation, transmission, and distribution to customers with
8 oversight from a public regulator. The utility company makes sure that power is
9 generated, sent to the grid, and reaches customers. Customers in regulated markets
10 cannot choose who generates their power and are bound to the utility in that area.
11 Regulated markets dominate most of the Southeast, Northwest and much of the West
12 (excluding California).
13 In a deregulated electricity market, the electricity industry is no longer controlled
14 by a single utility company, allowing multiple companies to compete in selling
15 electricity to consumers. In such instances, generators (companies that generate
16 electricity) sell electricity into a wholesale market, and retail energy suppliers purchase
17 this electricity to sell it to customers. Transmission companies or utilities own and
18 operate the transmission grid. The utility company exists to make sure the power is
19 distributed and everything is working correctly to keep the lights on. Electricity
20 deregulation gives consumers the power to choose their electric provider and plan. In
21 regulated energy markets, the local utility company sells electricity to residents. In

1 contrast, deregulated energy markets allow retail electric providers to sell energy plans
2 to customers.
3 The Legislature finds that the benefits of a deregulated electricity market include
4 opening the door to new technologies, such as transactional energy and blockchain
5 entrepreneurship, and giving consumers options they wouldn’t otherwise have. The
6 electricity industry competition gives consumers the power to choose their energy
7 supplier and the specific plan that best suits their needs. Deregulated markets can make
8 it easier for customers to purchase renewable, clean energy directly from generators and
9 push towards energy conservation.
10 Specifically, electricity deregulation can significantly impact consumers in
11 several ways:
12 (1) Price options: Consumers can potentially find lower rates by comparing
13 different suppliers.
14 (2) Customized plans: Suppliers may offer various plans tailored to different
15 usage patterns or preferences.
16 (3) Green energy access: Increased availability of renewable energy options for
17 environmentally conscious consumers.
18 (4) Customer service: Competition may lead to improved customer service as
19 suppliers vie for customers.
20 (5) Education requirement: Consumers need to educate themselves about the
21 market to make informed decisions.
22 The Legislature further finds that electricity deregulation in the United States
23 varies by state, with some states embracing full deregulation and others maintaining a
24 regulated market. States like Texas, Pennsylvania, and New York have fully deregulated
25 electricity markets, giving consumers a wide array of choices. Meanwhile, states like
26 California have partially deregulated markets, where only certain aspects of energy
27 supply are open to competition.
28 The Legislature finds that deregulated markets have opened up generation for
29 competition from independent power producers in 24 states, such as California, Texas

1 and most states in the Northeast. 18 of these states and Washington D.C. have also
2 introduced retail choice, which allows residential and/or industrial consumers to choose
3 their own electricity provider. Accordingly, the purpose of this legislation is to
4 deregulate the electric market in the CNMI to drive down prices by authorizing multiple
5 companies to sell electricity to customers and generating competition to provide a
6 broader range of electricity products such as renewable energy options.

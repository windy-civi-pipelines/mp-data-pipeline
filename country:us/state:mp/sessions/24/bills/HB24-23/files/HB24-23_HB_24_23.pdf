TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Regular Session, 2025 H. B. 24- 2 $›
A BILL FOR AN ACT
To amend 9 CMC § 2116 to update the definitions of "veteran"
and "disabled veteran" and to allow a valid Veteran ID Card to
be used as proof of veteran status when applying for a veteran's
license plate.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24TH NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Findings and Purpose. The Legislature finds that the current
2 requirements for obtaining a Veterans License Plate should be amended to provide
3 veterans with additional options for proving their eligibility. While the DD214
4 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty) has been the primary
5 document for verification, many veterans now possess a Veteran ID Card (VIC)
6 issued by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Since obtaining a VIC requires
7 a DD214, the VIC serves as official proof of veteran status and should be accepted
8 as an alternative form of veteran status verification in certain contexts. In particular,
9 the Legislature finds that the VIC should be accepted as an alternative form of
10 verification in the context of applying for a Veterans License Plate in the CNMI.

HOUSE BILL 24-
1 This bill also updates the definitions of "veteran" and "disabled veteran" to
2 explicitly include individuals who served in a reserve component of any branch of
3 the United States Armed Forces. Additionally, it removes the specific listing of
4 each military branch in favor of a broader reference to the Armed Forces. This
5 change ensures the law remains adaptable by allowing for the seamless inclusion
6 of newly established branches, such as the United States Space Force, without
7 requiring future legislative amendments.
8 Thus, based on the foregoing, the purpose of this Act is to amend 9 CMC
9 § 2116 to update the definitions of "veteran" and "disabled veteran" and to allow
10 valid VICs be used as proof of veteran status when applying for a veteran's license
11 plate. This amendment ensures that eligible veterans can more easily access the
12 benefits and recognition they deserve.
13 Section 2. Amendment. Sections 2116(a) and 2116(b)(1) of Chapter 1,
14 Division 2, Title 9 of the Commonwealth Code are hereby amended, with all other

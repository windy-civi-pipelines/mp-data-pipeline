4 representing Precinct II before later serving Precinct I on Saipan. Elected in 1989,
5 he served six consecutive terms through 2000, demonstrating principled leadership
6 and earning the respect of colleagues and constituents alike. As Speaker during the
7 9th, 10th, and 11th Northern Marianas Commonwealth Legislatures, he guided the

9 infrastructure, and educational systems, leaving a legacy of legislative achievement
10 that continues to benefit the community.

HOUSE LOCAL BILL 24-
1 Influential in advancing the CNMI' s standing throughout the Pacific region,
2 Diego Tenorio Benavente has worked to strengthen ties between island
3 governments and promote cooperative development. In addition to his service in
4 the Legislature, he also served one term from 2002-2006 as Lieutenant Governor
5 of the CNMI under the administration of Former Governor Juan Nekai Babauta,
6 where his leadership extended to the executive branch and reinforced his reputation
7 for integrity and dedication. Following his term, he was once again elected to the
8 House of Representatives, serving in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Northern
9 Marianas Commonwealth Legislatures, where he continued to champion tourism,
10 economic development, and resource management. Today, he continues to serve
11 the region as a member of the Board of Directors of the Pacific Islands
12 Development Bank and, since 2018, as the Honorary Consul of the Federated States
13 of Micronesia to the CNMI, roles through which he champions the growth and
14 prosperity of island communities.
15 Exceptional in his accomplishments beyond the halls of government, Diego
16 Tenorio Benavente is an avid fisherman who has worked to persevere and has
17 earned victories in several fishing derby categories, including twice being named
18 Grand Champion of the annual Saipan International Fishing Tournament. Many of
19 these marine activities begin at the Smiling Cove Marina on Saipan, a central harbor
20 and landmark for the fishing community. Smiling Cove has long been a gathering
21 place for fishermen, families, and visitors alike, and it is fitting that this landmark

HOUSE LOCAL BILL 24- 2/
1 be named in honor of a leader who both shaped public policy and lived the culture
2 of the sea. His life-long membership in the Saipan Fishermen's Association reflects
3 his deep connection to the maritime traditions of the Commonwealth and his
4 commitment to preserving them for future generations. Through both competition
5 and advocacy, he has helped foster pride in the CNMI' s fishing heritage and
6 inspired others to carry it forward.
7 Generous with his time, wisdom, and compassion, he has been a source of
8 guidance and support for countless individuals across the Commonwealth. As a
9 devoted husband, loving father, proud grandfather, supportive brother, and caring
10 uncle, Diego Tenorio Benavente is admired not only for his public service but for
11 the humility and kindness that define his character. These personal qualities have
12 made him as beloved in private life as he is respected in public life, creating a legacy
13 built on both achievement and service to humanity.
14 Owing to the Diego Tenorio Benavente's long-standing legacy as a
15 distinguished public servant and devoted fisherman, it is only fitting that the
16 relevant Smiling Cove Marina bears his name. This designation will serve as a
17 lasting tribute to his leadership, his contributions to the Commonwealth, and the
18 example he has set for future generations. By renaming Smiling Cove Marina, as
19 the "Diego T. Benavente Smiling Cove Marina," the Delegation affirms its
20 recognition of a lifetime dedicated to service, community, and the enduring values
21 that bind the Commonwealth together.

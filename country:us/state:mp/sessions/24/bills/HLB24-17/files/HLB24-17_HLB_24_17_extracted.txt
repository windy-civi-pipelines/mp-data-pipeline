Section 1:
TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
ril
SESSION, 2025 H.L.B. 24-
FOR THE FIRST SENATORIAL DISTRICT
To amend 10 CMC § 12114 to provide for the compensation of the
members of the Rota Casino Commission.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE FIRST SENATORIAL DISTRICT
DELEGATION PURSUANT TO CHAPTER 4, DIVISION 1, TITLE 1 OF
THE COMMONWEALTH CODE:
1 SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
2 The Legislature finds that the members of the Rota Casino Gaming
3 Commission were originally compensated with an annual salary of $65,000 per
4 year, consistent with the full-time nature of their responsibilities during the period
5 in which the Rota Casino was operational. Following the closure of the Rota
6 Casino, the salary structure for Commission members was changed to a per-
7 meeting stipend of $30 for a half-day meeting and $60 for a full-day meeting,
8 reflecting a significantly reduced scope of duties and activity.
9 However, the Legislature further finds that despite the absence of an
ri
HOUSE LOCAL BILL 24-
1 operational casino, the Commission continues to carry out regulatory,
2 administrative, and oversight functions, including preparation for potential future
3 gaming activity and maintaining compliance with relevant statutes. These
4 continuing responsibilities necessitate a more stable and adequate compensation
5 framework.
6 Therefore, the Rota Legislative Delegation finds it appropriate and
7 equitable to amend the current compensation scheme by establishing an annual
8 salary of $45,000 for each Commission member. This adjustment brings their
9 compensation in line with that of Rota Resident Department Heads and better
10 reflects the ongoing duties and obligations of the Commission, even in the absence
11 of an operating casino.
12 SECTION 2. AMENDMENT.
13 10 CMC § 12114 of the Commonwealth Code is amended to read:
14 "§ 12114. COMMISSION MEMBER COMPENSATION.
15 Members of the Commission shall each be compensated pursuant to 1 CMC
16 § 82'17 $45,000 per year and shall be reimbursed for their actual, necessary,
17 reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of their duties."
18 SECTION 3. SEVERABILITY.
19 If any provision of this Act or the application of any such provision to any
20 person or circumstance should be held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction,
21 the remainder of this Act or the application of its provisions to persons or
2
HOUSE LOCAL BILL 24- 11
1 circumstances other than those to which it is held invalid shall not be affected
2 thereby.
3 SECTION 4. SAVINGS CLAUSE.
4 This Act and any repealer contained herein shall not be construed as
5 affecting any existing right acquired under contract or acquired under statutes.
6 Repealers contained in this Act shall not affect any proceeding instituted under or
7 pursuant to prior law. The enactment of the Act shall not have the effect of
8 terminating, or in any way modifying, any liability, civil or criminal, which shall
9 already be in existence on the date this Act becomes effective.
10 SECTION 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.
11 This Act shall take effect upon its approval by the Governor or it becoming
12 law without such approval.

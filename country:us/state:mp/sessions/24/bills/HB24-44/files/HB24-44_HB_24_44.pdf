A BILL FOR AN ACT
To amend 9 CMC §8209 by removing the seven-day grace
period for motorists who violate 9 CMC §§8203 and 8204 with
the citation effective immediately; and for other purposes.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24TH NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Findings and Purpose. The Legislature finds that motorists
2 must be dutiful and responsible for the safety and security of our local roads. A
3 valid license, registration, and insurance are required documentation that ensure
4 compliance and assure road safety. Immediate fines are enforced once motorists are
5 found without valid license or registration on their person when operating a vehicle.
6 This is not the case for valid vehicle liability insurance. Not having consistent
7 enforcement with all the required documentation dampens compliance and safety
8 measures, especially since road incidents and their damages are unpredictable in
9 both occurrence and the extent of the damages. Having no insurance as a motorist
10 may also bear heavy financial risk and loss for parties involved should an accident
11 or injury occur. Therefore, having valid insurance should bear the same emphasis
12 as other required documents for vehicle operation.

HOUSE BILL 24-
1 The Legislature finds that pursuant to 9 CMC §§8203 and 8204,
2 respectively, motorists are not allowed to operate a vehicle unless the vehicle is
3 covered by and possesses minimum liability motor vehicle insurance. The
4 Legislature further finds that pursuant to 9 CMC §8209, all motorists who violate
5 9 CMC §8203 and 8204 are granted a seven-day grace period to submit satisfactory
6 evidence of minimum motor vehicle liability insurance to the Department of Public
7 Safety, providing coverage to avoid imposing such citation for violating 9 CMC
8 §8203. The Legislature finds that this type of practice is extremely detrimental to
9 the CNMI as uninsured motorists will be allowed to operate their vehicle for an
10 extra period of time. Within such time frame, these uninsured motorists may be
11 involved in a motor vehicle accident which may result in highly severe and
12 unfortunate consequences regardless of who bears the fault. To avoid such tragic
13 outcomes, it is imperative to remove the seven-day grace period provided under 9
14 CMC §8209 to deter uninsured motorists from operating their vehicles without the
15 required motor vehicle liability insurance. This removal will promote and enhance
16 better safety and financial management for all owners and operators of a motor
17 vehicle.
18 Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to amend 9 CMC §8209 by removing
19 the seven-day grace period for motorists who violate 9 CMC §§8203 and 8204 and
20 for other purposes and require that the civil citations be effective immediately.

14 satisfactory evidence of minimum motor vehicle liability insurance within
15 this seven day period to show compliance with 9 CMC § 8203 at the time

21 shall not be affected thereby.

LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Regular Session, 2025 H. B. 24- C S'
A BILL FOR AN ACT
To amend the penalties for illegally parking in spaces designated
for persons with disabilities by strengthening and enforcing clear
penalties for violation and repeat offenses and by ensuring
accessible parking for persons with disabilities; and for other
such purposes.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24TH NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Findings and Purpose. The Legislature finds that accessible
2 parking spaces are essential to support the accessibility, mobility, and dignity of
3 individuals with disabilities. Existing parking laws and signages do little to curb
4 the unauthorized use of disability parking spaces, as these designated parking spots
5 have been misused by private delivery vehicles, business service drivers, and
6 individuals ignoring posted restrictions. These parking violations seriously
7 inconvenience and impact individuals with disabilities, many reporting being
8 forced to park far from entrances or cancel necessary trips due to this abuse of
9 designated spaces.
10 The Legislature further finds that ensuring individuals have equal access to
11 public accommodations, including the strict protection of reserved parking, is vital

1 to the CNMI government's commitment to upholding the rights of persons with
2 disabilities under local and federal law. The current fines and penalties are
3 insufficient to deter violators, particularly corporate or repeat offenders, and does
4 not reflect the real harm caused to disabled residents. Therefore, the purpose of this
5 bill is to strengthen the enforcement of accessible parking laws, increase penalties
6 for violators, introduce escalating penalties for repeat offenses, and ensure that
7 parking access for persons with disabilities is preserved and respected.

9 Parking Areas Designated for Persons With Disabilities; Designation of Parking
10 Areas is hereby amended to read as follows:

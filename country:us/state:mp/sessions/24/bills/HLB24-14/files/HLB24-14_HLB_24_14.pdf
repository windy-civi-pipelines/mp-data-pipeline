6 benefit to the First Senatorial District to impose a 0.5% ad valorem local excise
7 surtax for the privilege of importing construction materials from outside the
8 Commonwealth into the First Senatorial District by any licensed construction
9 contractor conducting business within the First Senatorial District. The Delegation

HOUSE LOCAL BILL 2-41""
1 acknowledges that 4 CMC ยง 1402(a)(8) imposes 3% ad valorem excise tax for
2 construction equipment, construction materials, and construction machinery at the
3 point of entry in the CNMI. The same equipments, materials, and machinery
4 imported by licensed construction contractors intended for the First Senatorial
5 District as its final point of destination will be assessed a 3.5% excise tax. Of the
6 amount collected, 3% shall be remitted into the general fund and the 0.5% ad
7 valorem local surtax shall be remitted into the First Senatorial District Excise
8 Surtax Account. If the construction equipment, materials, and machinery are
9 purchased within the Commonwealth, but outside the First Senatorial District, the
10 0.5% ad valorem surtax shall be collected upon entry into the First Senatorial
11 District and shall be remitted into the First Senatorial District Excise Surtax
12 Account.
13 Therefore the purpose of this Act is to impose a 0.5% ad valorem local
14 excise surtax for the privilege of importing construction equipment, materials, and
15 machinery from outside and within the Commonwealth into the First Senatorial
16 District by licensed construction contractors conducting business within the First
17 Senatorial District.

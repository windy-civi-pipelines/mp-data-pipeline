TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
2.1
Session, 2025 H. B. 24-
A BILL FOR AN ACT
To establish the Joint Oversight of Incoming Non-local
Transfers Act to mandate Legislative and Executive
Appropriation for all Non-Locally-Sourced Funds allocated for
the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24T NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Findings. Federal and other non-locally-sourced funds comprise
2 a significant portion of the Commonwealth's operational and recovery budgets. The
3 Legislature finds that these funds, though external in origin, must remain subject to
4 local appropriation authority under Article II, Section 16 of the NMI Constitution.
5 Unchecked executive certification and expenditure of such funds has
6 repeatedly raised constitutional concerns and undermined public trust. In response,
7 the Twenty-Second Legislature enacted House Bill 22-33 to restore legislative
8 oversight and exercise more fiscal control over substantial funds that have
9 significant effects on the Commonwealth.
10 Notable examples illustrate the risk of not allowing the CNMI Legislature
11 to participate in the appropriation of these funds in a meaningful way. In the CNMI,
12 the misuse of BOOST program funds—later investigated and involved in court
13 proceedings—reflected the dangers of executive control without legislative

HOUSE BILL 24-
1 appropriation. Similarly, in Puerto Rico, the absence of legislative oversight over
2 post-Hurricane Maria recovery funds delayed aid and triggered federal audits and
3 investigations. The Legislature intends to proactively avoid similar situations.
4 Democratic governance requires that decisions over public expenditures
5 rest with the Legislature, as it holds the "power of the purse"—not just the Governor
6 or a single official. The appropriation power is foundational to the
7 Commonwealth's constitutional framework and must not be bypassed through
8 unilateral executive action. Safeguarding fiscal integrity and constitutional
9 balance, this Act reaffirms the Legislature's authority and ensures that no non-
10 locally-sourced funds may be expended or certified for expenditure without
11 legislative review and approval.
12 Section 2. Short Title. This Act may be cited as the "JOINT
13 Appropriations Act", which stands for Joint Oversight of Incoming Non-local
14 Transfers.
15 Section 3. Enactment. The following shall be enacted into law as new
16 Sections 7506 to 7511 within Title 1, Government, Division 7, Planning, Budgeting
17 and Auditing, Part I. Planning and Budgeting Act, Chapter 5. Federal Funds, of the
18 Commonwealth Code:
19 17506. Joint Oversight of Incoming Non-local Transfers.
20 Notwithstanding any Commonwealth law to the contrary, and unless

9 including from the U.S. Federal Government or any of its agencies,

12 §7507. Legislative Review of Proposed Certification of Non-

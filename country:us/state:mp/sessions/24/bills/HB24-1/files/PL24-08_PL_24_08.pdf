TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
FIRST DAY, SECOND SPECIAL SESSION
MAY 15, 2025
H. B. No. 24-1, HS1
AN ACT
To AMEND PROVISIONS IN TITLE 6, DIVISION 1, PART 1,
CHAPTER 3, SEXUAL OFFENSES, ARTICLE 1. GENERAL
PROVISIONS, RELATING TO SEXUAL ABUSE/ASSAULT OF
MINORS.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN
MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
2 Criminal acts against minors, particularly, sexual abuse and sexual assault
3 are serious crimes, acts of violence, and grave offenses. These offenses are
4 especially egregious when committed against minors who cannot legally give
5 consent in situations involving significant age differences. These acts of violence
6 often involve manipulation, coercion, force, or abuse of power, targeting those
7 perceived as vulnerable, including but not limited to children, individuals with
8 disabilities, and others in vulnerable situations. The Legislature, working
9 collaboratively with the CNMI Sexual Assault Response Team (SART),
10 considered feedback from the community, including youth, survivors, advocacy
11 groups, child protective agencies, and law enforcement, to ensure the

Public Law No. 24-08
HOUSE BILL 24-1, HS1
1 amendments herein, address the real needs and concerns of those affected by
2 these crimes.
3 Here in the CNMI, these crimes cause severe short and long-term effects on
4 victims, including children and adolescents. These effects can manifest as post-
5 traumatic stress disorder, suicide, self-harm, eating and sleep disorders,
6 dissociation, depression, and substance abuse. No person, particularly no child,
7 should endure such trauma. Furthermore, it is crucial to prohibit any form of
8 sexual activity between students and individuals employed or contracted by their
9 educational institutions. School employees and contractors hold positions of
10 authority and are responsible for students' protection and care. Therefore,
11 expressly banning any form of sexual interaction between these groups is
12 necessary.
13 Evidence and data obtained from various agencies within the CNMI
14 emphasize the urgent need to strengthen legal protections for victims. The
15 Division of Youth Services - Child Protective Services reported the following
16 allegations of sexual abuse: 41 in FY 2016, 44 in FY 2017, 44 in FY 2018, 63 in
17 FY 2019, 63 in FY 2020, 63 in FY 2021, 88 in FY 2022, and 115 in FY 2023.
18 According to the Department of Public Safety - Criminal Investigation Bureau, in
19 2023, there were 17 reported cases of sexual assault (SA) and 55 cases of sexual
20 abuse of a minor (SAM). As of September 2024, the numbers show 9 SA cases and
21 24 SAM cases. Data from the Office of the Attorney General - Criminal Division
22 reveal the following for SA cases (which encompass both sexual abuse of minors
23 and sexual assault cases): 12 in 2015, 25 in 2016, 17 in 2017, 15 in 2018, 11 in
24 2019, 20 in 2020, 31 in 2021, 31 in 2022, and 28 in 2023.
25 Sexual abuse and sexual assault victims are extremely vulnerable and
26 sadly, as the above statistics demonstrate, a significant percentage of the victims
27 are minors, further highlighting the vulnerability of this population and the
28 necessity for enhanced legal measures. As a community dedicated to protecting
2

Public Law No. 24-08
HOUSE BILL 24-1, HS1
1 its most vulnerable members and strongly opposing these malicious acts, the
2 Legislature finds that we must renew our commitment to these victims by
3 reinforcing and securing their protection from crimes involving the sexual abuse
4 of minors and sexual assault. This commitment is essential for safeguarding both
5 current and future generations. Combined with our efforts to deter these crimes
6 and ensure offenders are held accountable, the safety and well-being of both
7 children and adult victims depend on the protection and support we provide.
8 To address this, it is crucial to strengthen our laws regarding the sexual
9 abuse of minors and sexual assault by simplifying statutory language, removing
10 barriers to prosecution, and introducing a long-overdue voyeurism statute which
11 is critical, as increased access to technology—such as hidden cameras and online
12 dissemination—has made children and vulnerable individuals more susceptible
13 to exploitation. Current statutes (6 CMC § 1306 and § 1307) prohibit sexual
14 penetration or contact with persons under thirteen (13) years of age; the
15 Legislature proposes raising this age limit to fifteen (15) years to better protect
16 minors. This change aligns with most jurisdictions that have raised their ages of
17 consent to offer increased protection for minors and enhance the overall safety of
18 the community. Moreover, the Legislature finds that it would be appropriate to
19 update certain definitions to cover other circumstances not included in the
20 previous laws. Terms such as 'consent' and 'voyeurism' are revised and added to
21 bring CNMI law up to date with the realities of current societal challenges.
22 Existing laws also fail to address voyeurism. Unlike many other
23 jurisdictions, the CNMI lacks a statute criminalizing the intentional invasion of
24 another person's privacy without their consent while observing that person in the
25 privacy of their own home or another private place. Currently, these offenses are
26 often classified under the general charge of Disturbing the Peace, complicating
27 efforts to identify specific instances of voyeurism. This broad classification leads
28 to unjust outcomes for victims, as offenders typically face only petty misdemeanor
3

Public Law No. 24-08
HOUSE BILL 24-1, HS1
1 charges. Moreover, existing penalties do not adequately reflect the emotional and
2 psychological harm inflicted by these violations. A specific voyeurism statute
3 would address the rise in such acts, create stiffer penalties to hold offenders
4 accountable, and recognize the emotional and psychological harm to victims.
5 Revisions to current CNMI law set forth herein in the form of repealed and
6 re-enacted statutes that were substantively revised as well as minor amendments
7 to statutes that were necessary to update certain sections that are contained in
8 this legislation are all in compliance with the constitutional "one-subject" rule.
9 This is because all the legislative changes herein relate to Title 6, Ch. 3, Sexual
10 Offenses, Article 1. General Provisions, specifically, to sexual abuse/assault of
11 minors.
12 SECTION 2. REPEAL AND RE-ENACTMENT.
13 Title 6, Section 1306 of the Commonwealth Code is hereby repealed and

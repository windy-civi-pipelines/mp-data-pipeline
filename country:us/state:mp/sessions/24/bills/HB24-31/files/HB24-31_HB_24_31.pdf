TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
ciWkt. // i Mr
Th ii ç 1XRegn4aT Session, 2025 H. B. 24-
A BILL FOR AN ACT
To repeal restrictions on the use of funds in accounts
established under 4 CMC §§ 1215 and 53036(g).
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24T11 NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Findings and Purpose. The Legislature finds that the CNMI
2 Cannabis Commission is currently facing significant challenges in securing funding
3 for its core functions, including the payment of salaries and wages for
4 Commissioners and staff. Although the Commission has access to two separate
5 special revenue funding sources, existing statutory restrictions limit the
6 Commission's ability to use those funds to meet its needs.
7 Specifically, 4 CMC § 1512 creates the Cannabis Tax Account (CTA) as a
8 special account, separate and apart from the General Fund, to receive gross revenue
9 taxes collected from licensees regulated by the Cannabis Commission. While these
10 funds are subject to legislative appropriation and are ostensibly intended to support
11 cannabis-related regulatory functions, current law mandates that 25% of all
12 appropriations from the CTA be allocated to the Public School System (PSS).
13 The Legislature finds that this fixed percentage requirement reduces its

41
HOUSE BILL 24-
1 ability to respond to the evolving financial needs of the CNMI Cannabis
2 Commission. Specifically, the inability to appropriate a larger portion of CTA funds
3 to the Commission constrains the Legislature's ability to address the Commission's
4 funding challenges.
5 The Legislature further finds that removing the 25% allocation to PSS from
6 the CTA does not violate Article XV, Section 1(e) of the NMI Constitution, which
7 guarantees the Public School System an annual budget of no less than twenty-five
8 percent of the general revenues of the Commonwealth. As clarified by the CNMI
9 Supreme Court in In the Matter of a Petition for Certified Question, 2020 MP 2,
10 the constitutional guarantee under Article XV, Section 1(e) of the NMI
11 Constitution, applies only to general revenues of the CNMI—not special revenues,
12 which are revenues that have a direct connection between their source and their
13 designated purpose. Because the CTA is funded exclusively through cannabis-
14 related taxes and is intended to support cannabis regulation, it qualifies as a special
15 revenue fund. Because the CTA is a special revenue fund, the constitutional
16 requirement that PSS receive a portion of general revenues does not apply, meaning
17 the 25% reserve requirement may lawfully be repealed.
18 The Legislature also finds that 4 CMC § 53036(g) provides that all license
19 and application fees collected by the Commission must be deposited into a separate
20 account to pay for the "operation" of the Commission, subject to legislative
21 appropriation.
2

HOUSE BILL 24- 'I
1 However, because 4 CMC § 53036(g) does not define the term "operation,"
2 it is unclear whether the fund may be used for personnel costs, such as the salaries
3 and wages of the Commission. It is unclear because the CNMI Government's
4 annual appropriation acts typically include a Schedule A that further divides each
5 appropriation into three distinct categories: Personnel, Operations, and Utilities.
6 Although § 53036(g) authorizes the use of these fees for the "operation" of the
7 Commission, it is unclear whether the fees can only be used to supplement the
8 "Operations" in Schedule A, which excludes personnel costs, or whether the fees
9 can also be used to fund personnel salaries and wages. The amendment clarifies
10 that funds collected under 4 CMC § 53036(g) are to be appropriated to and
11 expended by the Cannabis Commission for any lawful purpose reasonably
12 necessary to fulfill its mandate, including all expenses and costs related to the
13 Commission's personnel, operations, and utilities.
14 Thus, to address these limitations, this Act removes the requirement under
15 4 CMC § 1512 that 25% of all appropriations from the CTA be allocated to PSS
16 and amends 4 CMC § 53036(g) to clarify that license and application fees may be
17 used for operations, personnel, utilities, and other reasonably necessary costs and
18 expenses of the Cannabis Commission.

13 Section 4. Reversion of Public School System Allocation Within the
14 Cannabis Tax Account.
15 If, prior to the effective date of this Act, an appropriation or other legislative
16 measure has directed the Secretary of Finance to establish a subaccount within the
17 Cannabis Tax Account (CTA) for the purpose of segregating or reserving funds for
18 the Public School System (PSS) pursuant to 4 CMC § 1512, such subaccount shall,
19 upon enactment of this Act, be dissolved. Any unappropriated funds segregated,

HOUSE BILL 24-
1 reserved, or allocated to PSS within the CTA shall revert to the general balance of
2 the CTA and shall be available for appropriation and expenditure in accordance
3 with the provisions of this Act and applicable law. Any funds that have been
4 appropriated to PSS shall remain available to PSS for expenditure unless otherwise
5 modified by law. The Secretary of Finance is hereby authorized to effectuate the
6 foregoing by taking all necessary administrative actions to dissolve the subaccount
7 and to reclassify or reallocate any funds previously segregated under the repealed
8 25% allocation requirement in 4 CMC § 1512.
9 Section 5. Severability. If any provisions of this Act or the application of
10 any such provision to any person or circumstance should be held invalid by a court
11 of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this Act or the application of its
12 provisions to persons or circumstances other than those to which it is held invalid
13 shall not be affected thereby.

18 instituted under or pursuant to prior law. The enactment of the Act shall not have
19 the effect of terminating, or in any way modifying, any liability, civil or criminal,
20 which shall already be in existence on the date this Act becomes effective.

TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
n. B.
Special Session, 2025
A BILL FOR AN ACT
To streamline business licensing in the
Commonwealth by establishing a business start-
up task force, a digital one-stop platform, a
support center, and a conditional business
licensing process.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24TH NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Short Title. This Act shall be known as the "CNMI OneStop
2 Business Start-Up Act."
3 Section 2. Findings and Purpose. Under current CNMI law, business
4 licensing and permitting processes are administered separately by various
5 regulatory agencies. Applicants are required to obtain approvals and submit
6 paperwork across multiple offices, often necessitating repeated in-person visits.
7 The system relies heavily on paper-based forms and manual coordination, with no
8 centralized digital platform to guide applicants or track permit statuses.
9 The Legislature acknowledges that an effort to address these challenges was
10 undertaken through Public Law 12-76, which established a Business Application
11 Task Force. Under that enactment, the Task Force was mandated to develop a

24-
HOUSE BILL (t
1 comprehensive plan for the creation of a "One-Stop Business License Application
2 Center," with the participation of representatives from all pertinent licensing
3 agencies. The Task Force was further directed to review existing procedures,
4 conduct public hearings, and assess the feasibility of implementing a centralized
5 electronic processing system via an online platform. Notwithstanding these
6 directives, no unified online platform was established. Moreover, although Public
7 Law 12-76 required the submission of formal recommendations to the Governor
8 and the Legislature within ninety days, it appears that no substantive progress was
9 achieved. Indeed, while it is possible that documentation was at some point
10 prepared, it cannot be located or independently verified at this time.
11 Despite the intent of Public Law 12-76, the core challenges it sought to
12 resolve persist. The Legislature finds that the existing licensing and permitting
13 framework remains inefficient, fragmented, and outdated. Entrepreneurs and small
14 business owners face considerable delays and confusion when navigating different
15 agency requirements, with no single access point to understand or fulfill all
16 necessary obligations. This disjointed process increases administrative burdens,
17 operating costs, and discourages new business formation. The lack of digital
18 infrastructure prevents real-time tracking, hinders transparency, and limits access
19 for those operating remotely or outside of the CNMI. Additionally, without a
20 formalized process for conditional business licensing, businesses are unable to
2

HOUSE BILL 2 41 Vif
1 begin operations while awaiting final approvals—creating unnecessary delays and
2 economic opportunity loss.
3 To address these issues, this Act repeals and replaces the "Business License
4 Application Task Force" with the "CNMI Business Start-Up Coordination Task
5 Force" and mandates the creation of a comprehensive, centralized digital
6 platform—referred to as the "Digital OneStop Platform." In addition to
7 streamlining application procedures, this Act also introduces a mechanism for
8 conditional business operation during the permit review period, enabling applicants
9 to begin limited business operation activities.
10 The CNMI Business Start-Up Coordination Task Force, established under
11 the Office of the Governor and chaired by the Secretary of Commerce, includes
12 representatives from all CNMI government entities involved in business licensing,
13 permitting, or regulatory approvals. It is responsible for overseeing the design,
14 development, and implementation of the Digital OneStop Platform; coordinating
15 interagency requirements; standardizing procedures; and ensuring continuous
16 collaboration and system improvement. Its establishment formalizes interagency
17 coordination, promotes transparency, and ensures that the digital licensing system
18 evolves through structured oversight and stakeholder engagement.
19 The Digital OneStop Platform consolidates all business licensing and
20 permitting requirements into a single online interface. It provides access to required
21 forms, tracks the status of applications, enables online payments, and allows users
3

HOUSE BILL 42 ,4" . 3 11
1 to view agency feedback and deadlines in real-time. Additionally, it addresses the
2 inefficiencies of the current system by consolidating fragmented agency processes
3 into a unified digital platform, thereby eliminating the need for multiple physical
4 visits and manual submissions. The digital platform does not replace or override
5 the statutory authority of agencies but instead consolidates agency application
6 procedures into a centralized, transparent, and accessible interface administered by
7 the Department of Commerce.
8 To support users navigating the Digital OneStop Platform, the "CNMI
9 Business Start-Up Help Center" is established within the Department of
10 Commerce. The Help Center operates as a physical service location and
11 administrative support facility, equipped with computer resources and staffed by
12 trained personnel. It provides in-person, phone, and online assistance, including
13 technical support, guidance on completing applications, and educational resources
14 on using the digital platform. By promoting equitable access and reducing barriers
15 for underserved applicants and individuals with limited digital literacy, the Help
16 Center enhances user engagement and supports broader economic inclusion.
17 Last, this Act introduces conditional business licenses, which allows
18 businesses to commence limited operations while awaiting inspections and final
19 agency approvals, subject to a 60-day compliance window. These conditional
20 business licenses are only available through the Digital One Stop Platform, ensuring
21 that all agency data and applicant progress remain transparent and traceable.
4

HOUSE BILL 2 43
1 Additionally, restricting conditional business licenses to those who apply through
2 the digital platform encourages applicants to use new system and reduces regulatory
3 blind spots. By introducing conditional business licensing, this Act provides a
4 practical mechanism for businesses to begin operations sooner—without
5 compromising regulatory oversight or public safety.
6 Thus, this Act establishes the institutional and technological foundation
7 necessary to streamline business licensing and permitting, promote transparency,
8 and support new business enterprise formation.
9 Section 3. Repeal and Replacement. Article 4 of Chapter 6, Division 5,
10 Title 4 of the Commonwealth Code is hereby repealed and replaced with the

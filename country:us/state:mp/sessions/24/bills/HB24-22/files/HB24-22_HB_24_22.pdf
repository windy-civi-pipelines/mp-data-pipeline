TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
22
Regular Session, 2025 H. B. 24-
A BILL FOR AN ACT
To repeal and reenact the Justice Center Fund Revolving
Account.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24TH NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Findings and Purpose. Legislative oversight of dedicated
2 public funds is essential, especially when the original purpose of a fund has been
3 fulfilled. Over thirty years have passed since the enactment of Public Law 7-25,
4 which established the Justice Center Fund to finance the construction of judicial
5 facilities through a USDA Rural Development Loan.
6 Over time, the loan has been fully satisfied, and the Justice Center is now
7 fully constructed. With the original obligation discharged, continuing to earmark
8 court-generated fines and fees solely for this retired debt no longer reflects prudent
9 fiscal management or the intent of enabling legislation.
10 Accordingly, the Legislature finds it appropriate to repeal and reenact 1
11 CMC § 3405 to redirect these funds. The new structure preserves 25% of revenues
12 for Judiciary maintenance while transferring the remaining 75% into the General
13 Fund to support public safety and infrastructure.

22
HOUSE BILL 24-
1 Now more than ever, every dollar collected by the courts must serve a
2 broader public purpose. Redirecting a portion of these funds to the General Fund
3 ensures that legislative appropriation authority is respected and that resources are
4 allocated in a way that reflects current priorities and financial realities.
5 Section 2. Repeal and Re-enactment. Title 1, Government, Division 3,
6 Judicial Branch, Chapter 4, Judiciary Administration, section 3405 "Justice Center
7 Fund," is hereby repealed and reenacted to read as follows:
8 "§ 3405. Justice Center Fund.
9 (a) There is hereby established a revolving fund within the Department of
10 Finance that shall be known and designated as the Justice Center Fund Revolving
11 Account. This revolving account shall be accounted for separately from the General
12 Fund. Commencing on the date of disbursement of the loan proceeds from USDA,
13 all criminal and civil fines and all revenues collected by the courts of the
14 Commonwealth pursuant to 1 CMC § 3403, and all fines or fees collected pursuant
15 to any other law and remitted or paid to the Commonwealth Treasury pursuant to 7
16 CMC § 3206 and 7 CMC § 3251, shall be deposited and credited to the Justice
17 Center Fund Revolving Account.
18 (b) The expenditure authority for the Justice Center Fund Revolving
19 Account shall be the Chief Justice.
20 (c) The Justice Center Fund Revolving Account's purpose shall be used as
21 follows:
2

HOUSE BILL 24- a
1 (1) Twenty-five percent of the funds collected pursuant to subsection (a)
2 shall remain in the Justice Center Fund Revolving Account to be used to
3 supplement the maintenance needs of the Judiciary's facilities; and
4 (2) Seventy-five percent of the funds collected pursuant to subsection (a)
5 shall be deposited into the General Fund and shall be used as follows:
6 i) Five percent of the funds collected shall be allocated to the
7 Department of Public Works. The expenditure authority of these funds shall
8 be the Secretary of the Department of Public Works.
9 ii) Seventy percent of the funds collected shall be allocated to the
10 Department of Public Safety. The expenditure authority of these funds shall
11 be the Commissioner of the Department of Public Safety."
12 Section 3. Severability. If any provisions of this Act or the application of
13 any such provision to any person or circumstance should be held invalid by a court
14 of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this Act or the application of its
15 provisions to persons or circumstances other than those to which it is held invalid
16 shall not be affected thereby.
17 Section 4. Savings Clause. This Act and any repealer contained herein
18 shall not be construed as affecting any existing right acquired under contract or
19 acquired under statutes repealed or under any rule, regulation, or order adopted
20 under the statutes. Repealers contained in this Act shall not affect any proceeding
21 instituted under or pursuant to prior law. The enactment of the Act shall not have
3

HOUSE BILL 24- II
1 the effect of terminating, or in any way modifying, any liability, civil or criminal,
2 which shall already be in existence on the date this Act becomes effective.
3 Section 5. Effective Date. This Act shall take effect upon its approval by
4 the Governor, or it becoming law without such approval.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
c9e,o 21pIi
SESSION, 2025 H. L. B.
FOR THE THIRD SENATORIAL DISTRICT
To amend the Saipan Zoning Law of 2013, Section 1211 concerning
nonconforming auto rental offices with vehicles, for enhanced
industry clarity and infrastructure utilization in the Third Senatorial
District; and for other purposes.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE THIRD SENATORIAL DISTRICT
DELEGATION PURSUANT TO CHAPTER 4, DIVISION 1, TITLE 1 OF
THE COMMONWEALTH CODE:
1 SECTION 1. FINDINGS.
2 The Delegation finds that the restructuring of the Garapan Paseo de
3 Marianas, including roadway reconstruction within the Garapan Core, Garapan
4 East, and Tourist Resort zoning districts, has created new parking opportunities.
5 Newly constructed parking stalls and curb-side parking areas have opened access
6 to business establishments. Consequently, auto rental offices with on-site rental
7 vehicles in these districts will no longer be considered in violation of the Saipan
8 Zoning Law. Given these findings, the Delegation concludes that Section 1211 of
2q--11
HOUSE LOCAL BILL
1 the Saipan Zoning Law of 2013, regarding nonconforming auto rental offices with
2 vehicles, should be deleted in its entirety. Upon this amendment becoming law,

4 regarding nonconforming auto rental offices with vehicles under the Saipan Zoning
5 Law of 2013.

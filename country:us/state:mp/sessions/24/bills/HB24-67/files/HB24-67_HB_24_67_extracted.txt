Section 1:
TWENTY-FOURTH NORTHERN MARIANAS COMMONWEALTH
LEGISLATURE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Regular Session, 2025 H. B. 24- & q
To promote government transparency, accountability, and
digital accessibility by requiring standardized reporting of
financial and grant information by all CNMI government
entities, instrumentalities, and nonprofit recipients of public
funds, in compliance with the Constitution, the Covenant, and
applicable laws of the Commonwealth; and for other purposes.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE 24TH NORTHERN MARIANAS
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATURE:
1 Section 1. Short Title: This Act shall be known and may be cited as the
2 "CNMI Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2025 (CNMI-DATA
3 Act).".
4 Section 2. Finding and Purpose: The Legislature finds that transparency
5 is a cornerstone of good governance and a fundamental constitutional principle in
6 the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). Article II of the
7 CNMI Constitution guarantees the people the right to access public information,
8 ensuring that government operations remain open and accountable. This
HOUSE BILL 24- (P1
1 commitment is reinforced by the Covenant between the CNMI and the United
2 States, which calls for sound governance and rigorous financial accountability.
3 Furthermore, the Legislature finds that to uphold this standard, public funds
4 must be consistently tracked and reported in a manner that is accurate,
5 comprehensive, and accessible. Drawing on the U.S. DATA Act as a model, the
6 CNMI recognizes the importance of standardized financial reporting and seeks to
7 implement similar measures to provide clear and reliable information to the public.
8 These requirements apply broadly across government and related entities. All
9 executive departments, offices, commissions, instrumentalities, and public
10 corporations-along with nonprofit organizations receiving CMI or federal funds-
11 are expected to comply with these standards. Leadership and oversight are critical:
12 the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Department of Finance (DOF),
13 and the Office of the Public Auditor (OPA) are responsible for establishing,
14 enforcing, and auditing digital financial reporting practices. Ultimately, public trust
15 depends on accessibility. Residents of the CNMI should be able to review
16 government spending, procurement, and grant activity through clear, timely, and
17 searchable online reports, ensuring transparency and accountability at every level
18 of government. Therefore, the purpose of the Act is to ensure uniform digital
19 reporting of financial data, increase accountability, and expand public access.
